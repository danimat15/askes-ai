00:00:21 Yeah. So hello everyone, welcome to the project. So in this session we'll be developing
00:00:27 one amazing end to end yeah so medical chatbot uh with the help of large language model
00:00:34 langchen pine cone flask and AWS. So these kinds of implementation I'll be
00:00:41 bringing in my channel uh frequently. So many of you have already requested me
00:00:46 for that sir try to bring different different project implementation uh series on the channel so that we can
00:00:53 learn right. So uh uh just to tell you guys I also implemented or recorded one
00:01:00 medical chatbot video uh but it was like uh little bit older implementation. So
00:01:06 there uh many things has been updated and because of that uh there are many people actually they are having issue
00:01:12 with the setup. So they requested me personally sir u I'm not able to execute
00:01:17 your medical chatbot project because pine cone is uh giving this kinds of error. Okay. So how we can uh resolve
00:01:24 that because if you see the pine cone environment so they have updated their uh like code base. Okay. So right now uh
00:01:32 uh let's say if you want to use the pine cone you have to use a you have to use it in a different way okay but
00:01:37 previously it was uh in a different way right so that's why I decided to reimplement this medical chatbot uh with
00:01:44 the updated let's say code uh so that you won't be facing any kinds of issue okay so in this session I'm going to
00:01:51 show you how we can uh implement completely end to end this medical
00:01:57 chatbot with the help of large language model and uh for the orchestration
00:02:02 framework I'm going to use the langin and uh vector database wise I'm going to use the pine cone and uh for the
00:02:10 front-end development I'll be using flask and uh this one uh for for the
00:02:16 deployment actually I'm going to use the AWS services okay uh with the combination of all the tool we'll try to
00:02:22 implement the entire projects as an end to end okay so this is the idea
00:02:30 Yeah. So, uh I think guys my voice is audible to all of you. Let me know. Uh
00:02:36 yeah. So, my voice is audible guys. Let me know. And and if you have any question, please
00:02:41 let me know in the chat. Yeah. And and uh you can ask me why I started this uh
00:02:47 like implementation as live because what I feel like live coding, live coding is always fun. So here uh we'll try to
00:02:54 implement everything in a live mode. You can also bring your system. You can also
00:02:59 uh do the code with me. Right? So that's how uh uh we can uh get together and we
00:03:05 can implement this kinds of projects. Okay. Instead of recording the video, I think that would be fine. Right? Yeah.
00:03:11 So this is my request guys. So whenever let's say I'm going to uh schedule the next session for the development, make
00:03:18 sure you uh you you just uh connect with your laptop or desktop. Okay? instead of joining from your mobile phone. So um uh
00:03:25 I I want you to join with your system because we'll implement together. Okay. We'll implement together so that uh it
00:03:31 would be a kinds of fun. Okay. Yeah. Yeah guys. And uh there is another
00:03:36 confirmation the computer vision playlist I started it will uh recontinue. No need to worry. So I'll
00:03:42 try to complete each and everything whatever things uh are left. Okay. So far I'll try to complete them also. So
00:03:49 uh we'll also continue this project implementation. We'll also try to continue the computer vision playlist.
00:03:54 Okay. Both we'll try to complete. Yeah. So uh let's uh start the implementation
00:04:00 guys. But before the implementation, first of all, I want to give you the idea about medical chatbot and uh uh and
00:04:08 like the architecture of the chatbot like how we're going to develop that and definitely I'm also going to uh uh talk
00:04:16 about the technology and tools stack actually we'll be using to develop the entire system. Okay, then after that we
00:04:23 can start the development. Okay, so this session will take time guys. Okay. So,
00:04:28 uh make sure you uh sit uh uh with me and try to complete the entire let's
00:04:35 implementation because here we are not going to implement only one component. We'll be implementing till deployment.
00:04:40 Okay. So definitely this session will take some time. So I want you to just sit with me and try to complete the
00:04:46 entire playlist guys. Okay. And if you're busy right now if you can't join no need to worry. I think this recording
00:04:52 would be available on my channel. So anytime you can open it up and you can start the implementation and all the
00:04:58 code materials everything I'm going to share in the description even I'm also going to share my GitHub link with you.
00:05:04 Okay. So that you can also get the code from there. Start agents playlist. Yeah.
00:05:10 So in this playlist only we'll be continuing with the agents implementation as well Shiva. Okay.
00:05:15 Yeah. So this is this is the like let me show you. I I created a playlist. Uh you
00:05:20 can see I created a playlist called end to end generative vi projects. Okay. So if you open it up so here uh this is the
00:05:27 uh playlist and here I already uploaded one video. Uh you can see build gener generative vi powered job recommenered
00:05:34 system with MCP. Okay. So u this is the first video guys I uploaded in this
00:05:39 playlist and this is the second one actually uh today we are doing. Okay. And today we'll be implementing the
00:05:44 medical chatbot because uh what I can say this this is a good project and even you can also
00:05:50 mention this project in your resume. Okay. So this is a like amazing project from the healthcare site. You can also
00:05:56 watch this one uh if you want. Okay. So in this playlist only I'll keep on adding the new projects. Okay. The new
00:06:02 projects actually I'm going to teach you. So whether it's a AI agents, whether it's a MCP, whether it's a any
00:06:08 kinds of ragbased system. Okay. Everything will update in this particular playlist itself. Okay. Yeah,
00:06:14 fine. And one more request guys. So, please
00:06:20 try to hit the like. All of you just hit the like and if you are new to my channel, if you haven't subscribed yet,
00:06:26 so please try to subscribe to my channel guys. Let's hit 50k subscriber as soon as possible guys. Only I just need your
00:06:32 support. Uh and uh I promise uh everything I will provide. Okay.
00:06:37 Whatever you need from my end, I'll try to provide in my channel. Yeah.
00:06:42 Fine guys. So uh let's start the discussion. So I think guys you already
00:06:48 know about medical chatbot. Okay. What is medical chatbot? I think all of you are familiar with chatbot. Like what is
00:06:53 chatbot exactly, right? So I don't need to explain about the chatbot.
00:06:59 So this is medical chatbot right? Chatbot. So what is
00:07:08 chatbot exactly? chatbot pins let's say this is a conversational uh conversational actually
00:07:15 uh system so here you can do the conversation okay regarding uh any kinds of topic but here the main focus is to
00:07:23 create the chatbot to the medical domain let's say uh I think you know that guys
00:07:29 uh we we we need a doctor right let's say if we if we are suffering with any kinds of disease if we need any kinds of
00:07:35 help uh related our health okay so definitely We we need the uh we need the
00:07:40 let's say help from the doctor's side and it is not possible to actually go to
00:07:47 the doctor actually anytime okay it's not possible if you are going to the doctor so you have to book the
00:07:53 appointment then you have to wait for the date okay then you'll be able to meet the doctor so what we can do we can
00:08:00 u uh create a kinds of assistant system okay medical assistant system uh we can
00:08:06 uh use some sort of data okay to let's say give some knowledge to the uh
00:08:12 chatbot so that uh if you are suffering with any kinds of disease if you are suffering with with any kinds of problem
00:08:19 you can open your bot and you can ask like I'm suffering this particular issue or let's say I'm having uh this issue so
00:08:26 what uh your chatbot will do instantly it will give you some suggestion it will give you some feedback what you need to
00:08:31 do exactly right so with that what is happening you don't need to book the appointment u uh like uh with the
00:08:38 doctor. So instantly you can get the feedback instantly you can get the suggestion and if there is a urgent
00:08:44 requirement okay you need a physical doctor definitely you can visit that time let's say uh this is this is the
00:08:50 night time let's say currently uh the the time is let's say 12 uh 12 a.m.
00:08:56 Okay. And it is not possible uh to go to the doctor at this at this time. So what I can do? I can open up my medical
00:09:02 chatbot and I I I can uh let's say give my concern. So definitely I will get some feedback with respect to that.
00:09:08 Maybe I can take some step right. So yeah. So these kinds of let's say chatbot these kinds of agents are
00:09:13 automating today's industry today's actually generation. So people are not depending on the uh let's say person
00:09:21 anymore. So they they're creating this kinds of automated system, automated platform and definitely they're let's
00:09:27 say getting lots of help from that right. So you have to also think in that way. So whatever domain you are working
00:09:32 it doesn't matter just try to figure the problem statement how you can automate this let's say problem statement with a
00:09:39 specific solution. So this is what at the end my uh objective is to show you whatever project let's say I'll try to
00:09:46 build up definitely there would be a use case okay there would be let's say some sort of domain okay a domain let's say
00:09:53 specification so with respect to that we'll try to develop a projects and definitely we'll be getting some idea
00:09:59 how you can utilize this kinds of jai these kinds of large language model whatever lang chain tool whatever let's
00:10:05 say vector database tool you have learned how you can apply in the real world let's say project implementation.
00:10:11 Okay. So each and everything I'm going to show you with a practical example with a practical development so that
00:10:17 your understanding would be more clear and if you if you are if you want to create anything else guys you can easily
00:10:23 do that. Okay. So this is my main intention to start this particular playlist because what I believe uh if
00:10:29 you are learning anything so unless and until you are not developing anything uh real time so definitely uh this
00:10:36 learning won't make sense. Okay. So that's why it is always important to develop something from your end. Okay.
00:10:42 Yeah. Because I I got like really good feedback uh of this project like medical chatbot. I think remember when I
00:10:48 published my first let's generate uh course on the YouTube channel. So this was the main project there like medical
00:10:55 chatbot and I got like lots of feedback from the uh people's side like this is a really good projects and I want to add
00:11:01 this project in my resume. I want to let's say add this project in my college uh project let's say submission. So I
00:11:08 got lots of feedback. So that's why I thought let's recreate this project with a new domain. Oh sorry with a new tool
00:11:13 with an updated code. Okay. So that you won't be having any kinds of issue. Okay. During executing the project this
00:11:19 is the main idea. Yeah. Yeah. This is for the beginner as well. You can also watch that. But uh to
00:11:26 understand this in detail you have to know about generative. Okay. Yeah. Manam
00:11:31 Sanjay what are the prerequisite to make this project? Prerequisite wise at least you
00:11:38 should familiar with generative VII concept. Okay. Yeah. And uh and some tools like langen
00:11:47 fine guys. So yeah we can start. So I think guys you already got the problem
00:11:53 statement. The problem statement we're going to develop. Now let's try to understand the architecture. Okay. How
00:11:58 we we are going to develop the project. Because if you see uh the large language model okay
00:12:04 LLM so there are like so many LLMs right now available in the market okay if you
00:12:10 open the internet and if you search a list of the large language model you will see like GPT is there okay you will
00:12:17 see like llama is there you will see like Mistral is there okay you will see
00:12:24 see like Gemma is there I think recently JMA has published Gemma 3 I think okay
00:12:29 Then uh there are like so many models are available. Okay. So many models are available and uh if you want to use this
00:12:37 model uh what you can do you can use this model in a three way. Okay. Either you can only do the inference let's say
00:12:45 you are taking this GPT model. Okay GPT model and what you are doing you are giving a prompt okay you are giving a
00:12:53 prompt and here you are getting a response. Okay response because this model has
00:12:59 trained with some specific data. So if I if I talk about GPT let's say I'm using
00:13:04 GPT4. So if you open the OpenAI website so you'll see that GPT4 has been trained
00:13:10 on uh train or trained on the entire internet data set till October. Okay
00:13:16 October 2023. So I'm not sure let me let me check
00:13:22 this. So if I open the open AI open AI models. Okay. So let's open the first
00:13:29 website. Uh, pine cone is free or paid. Uh, pine
00:13:36 cone is paid but uh, initially it will give you some free credits. Okay, Shiba.
00:13:42 So maybe you can create one to two cluster and uh, you will be getting 1 GB of space. Okay, so there uh, you can
00:13:48 store your vector and you can perform the operations. But uh, if you if you want to store more more than that you
00:13:55 have to purchase their premium subscription. But uh mostly we'll be using the free services, okay? Not the
00:14:01 paid one. So here you can see guys this is the openi website and here we are having lots of model. Okay. Now let's
00:14:08 try to open up the GPT4 model. So I think GPT4 is there somewhere. Uhhuh. So
00:14:14 GPT4. Yeah. So you can see GPT4 is there. So if I open the GPT4, so here you can see uh the knowledge base of the
00:14:21 GPT4 the knowledge cutff. Sorry, it was not October. It was December December 1, 2023. Okay. So, let me just
00:14:29 uh rub it. So, this is
00:14:35 uh December, right? Yeah. So, December 1.
00:14:43 December. Okay. December 1, 2023.
00:14:51 Okay. So, this is the knowledge cut off of of GPT4. So that's how if you open any kinds of model whether it's llama
00:14:58 whether it's a mistral whether it's a gymma all the model has their uh knowledge cutoff okay knowledge cutoff
00:15:05 means uh the data they are using for the training purpose for the training
00:15:10 purpose of this model some specific duration data okay so that means uh till
00:15:18 December 1 2023 whatever information you have in the internet whatever data you have in the
00:15:25 internet this model knows everything that means you can easily give any kinds of prompt and you can get the response
00:15:31 okay because the this kinds of LLM is a multitasking model you can perform all possible task right yeah but uh here
00:15:40 let's say your requirement is to create a specific application which will do
00:15:46 some specific work so for this what we can do guys I think you know that we can
00:15:51 uh give some prompt template we can mention the LLM like you are a assistant your task is that only right
00:15:58 if you are getting any other let's say command from the uh user you don't need to supposed to do that so that's how we
00:16:04 can also tweak the model and we can perform the task right but let's say you you have some custom data and you want
00:16:10 to utilize that you don't want to use the raw model you want to use the pre-teen model you you have some custom
00:16:17 data okay you want to utilize that so you can use your custom data in a two
00:16:22 different way either you can create a rag based system okay rag rag either you
00:16:28 can do the finetuning operation okay finetuning operation now all of you
00:16:34 already know that finetuning is not an easy task yes or no guys finetuning is not an easy task to do the finetuning
00:16:42 here you need lots of data okay the first thing you need lots of data data
00:16:49 the second thing you need the computational power. Okay, compute
00:16:54 power. So, compute power means you need a high configuration graphics card GPU.
00:17:00 Okay, and definitely you need some cost. Okay, what is the cost? Because if you're using your custom data, you have
00:17:07 to annotate those data. Okay, and GPU for GPU also you have to pay pay cost.
00:17:13 So that's why whenever I'm talking about the finetuning so here three things is involvement data the computational cost
00:17:22 so computational power and the cost okay so that's why finetuning is not an easy
00:17:27 task so it's not easy for us to do the finetuning as a developer okay it is
00:17:33 easy for like those company who has actually lots of budget so currently if I'm talking about big tech companies
00:17:39 they're having lots of budget they're having lots of money they're having a great infrastructure, they're having a
00:17:45 great let's say uh office, they're having some amazing employees. So they can easily do this kinds of finetuning
00:17:52 operations with a a specific large language model and that that is what they are doing. So every let's say uh uh
00:17:58 uh every 3 month, every 6 month they're bringing new new model to us, right? So this is what actually they are doing.
00:18:05 But as a developer, this is not easy for us to do the finetuning operations, right? So that's why mostly people will
00:18:13 be using the rag based approach. Okay. So ragbased approach. So in rag what we do let's say we have some custom data.
00:18:18 Okay. We have some custom data with the custom data we create something called knowledge base. Okay. Knowledge
00:18:27 knowledge base knowledge base and we connect our large language model LLM to
00:18:33 the knowledge base. Okay. So this is the idea. Got it? So here the approach will
00:18:39 be using rag approach. Okay, rag approach to implement the entire project because here the custom data I want to
00:18:46 use. Okay, so this is my own data. Okay, this is my own data and I want to use I
00:18:52 want to utilize this data to implement the entire system because I'm not satisfied with the pretend model
00:18:59 response. Okay, so let's say the medical chatbot I want I'm not satisfying with the pretend model response. So what I do
00:19:06 what I want to do I want to add some more information on top of that. Okay this model is already powerful but I
00:19:12 want to add some more information on top of that. So for this either you can use the finetuning approach either you can
00:19:18 use the rag approach but we are not going to use the finetuning approach because we don't have this many of
00:19:23 resources. Okay. So that's why the easyuh easy let's say approach would be the re approach. Okay. We'll be creating
00:19:29 a rag based system. So here we'll be utilizing our custom data. We'll try to create a knowledge base with the help of
00:19:35 vector database and the orchestration framework wise we'll be using langen and we'll be connecting our large language
00:19:41 model to the knowledge base and if you are asking anything with respect to the medical domain definitely your uh
00:19:48 chatbot will able to give you the response in a good way okay and I can use this uh chatbot for my personal
00:19:55 assistant even I can also do the business okay with this particular application maybe I can host this chat
00:20:01 chatbot for for the entire ired let's say user entire people so what they can do they can also come to my platform
00:20:08 they can also do the signup operations and they can take the help from my chatbot okay that's how you can also you
00:20:14 can do the business okay this is the idea now the uh custom data wise guys I am having an amazing book with me okay
00:20:21 so this book uh you can see he this book is having 637 pages okay this is like
00:20:26 very huge book and this book name is the gale uh inside uh opedia of medicine
00:20:34 second edition. Okay. So those who have studied uh let's say medical science I
00:20:40 think they are already familiar with this particular books. Okay. So these books is having uh almost all kinds of
00:20:46 let's say disease uh their diagnosis technique and the medicine. Okay. So if
00:20:51 you if you open the book so it is having lots of chapter. Okay. It is having lots of chapter. Okay. So let me show you
00:20:58 some glimpse of that. So if I open some of the page. So see guys.
00:21:05 So see uh here. Okay.
00:21:11 So ab abdominal wall defect. So this is one kinds of disease. So all the
00:21:18 information they have written about the disease. Okay. Uh then the prevention technique as well. That means the
00:21:24 diagnosis technique even uh see diagnostic technique even the treatment as well as it is also having some
00:21:30 medicine them okay like you can use this medicine to uh to let's say do the
00:21:35 treatment of this particular disease okay so that's how it is having almost all possible okay all possible disease
00:21:42 okay let's say abion uh abortion we have then we have something called uh see
00:21:48 this is another abortion abortion therap theraputic Then we have see also the diagram is
00:21:56 also having the visualization diagram like what it is exactly. Then uh you can
00:22:02 see some other disease as well like abs absess this is one of the disease.
00:22:10 Then you have uh see absess incision
00:22:15 and drainage. Okay. Then you have abuse.
00:22:21 So that's how if you if you see the book if you go through the entire book so all possible disease you will be able to see
00:22:26 see this is another disease okay even you can also search some kinds of disease see this is I think acne okay
00:22:34 acne okay so most of the uh person h has this po problem right acne problem and
00:22:40 why acne happens and uh what is the diagnosis technique okay each and everything they have already written
00:22:47 okay even the medicine you can use for this acne so yeah so I I can say this is a amazing book. Okay, I can say this is
00:22:54 the amazing book which is uh let's say uh I can utilize for my chatbot okay as
00:23:00 a knowledge base because if you want to be a doctor so what you have to do guys if you want to be a doctor so definitely
00:23:07 you have to gain lots of knowledge on on on this particular medical science and definitely you have to read a lots of
00:23:13 books you have to get the training then you'll be able to become a good doctor right because you know you know
00:23:20 everything about the disease you know everything about the treatment. So that's how we are becoming a doctor. So
00:23:26 we are following the same strategy that means we we are taking a model and and
00:23:32 we are giving some sort of data. We we're uh let's say giving some information uh to the model so that my
00:23:39 model model has all of the information regarding the medical science and later on if I'm asking anything definitely my
00:23:45 model will be g give something from that right. So this is what actually we are doing. So uh as a custom data wise we'll
00:23:52 be using the entire books. Okay we'll try to extract all of the uh content from the books and we'll try to create a
00:23:58 knowledge base. Okay this is the main idea. Got it? And with the help of that we'll try to create a RG system that
00:24:05 means rag system retable augmented generations. Okay. So those who have already studied generative AI I think
00:24:10 you know what is R. So if you are not familiar with geni guys so what I will suggest I will suggest you to watch my
00:24:16 generative playlist. So here is my playlist guys. Generative mastery full course. Okay. So here you will be
00:24:22 getting two parts the part one and the part two. Just try to complete the generative course. So it would be easy
00:24:28 for you to implement these kinds of projects. Okay. In a good way. Fine. So
00:24:33 this is what actually we'll be doing. Now let me show you the process. Okay. The process we'll be following the architecture will be following to
00:24:39 develop the entire projects. So here let's say we are having a books.
00:24:44 Okay. Here we are having a books medical book I can write a medical book
00:24:56 medical book and the book format is PDF okay PDF now it can be anything it can
00:25:03 be also docs it can be also txt it doesn't matter you can load any kinds of let's say file with the help of langen
00:25:10 okay I I'll show you how we can use the langen to load these kinds of documents so the First task is to extract all of
00:25:16 the content from these books. Okay. So here I'll try to write extract
00:25:23 extract uh the documents documents uh of the book.
00:25:33 Okay book. So after extracting what we have to do
00:25:38 guys we have to perform the chunking. CH
00:25:46 chunking okay chunking so why chunking is required because if you see um the
00:25:53 model let's say if I open the GPT4 model only so what is the context window of this model guys just try to see here so
00:26:00 it is uh uh uh the GPT4 context window is 8,192
00:26:06 tokens okay so that means it can take take 800 8,192
00:26:11 tokens okay as an input. Okay, highest input. If you're giving more than that,
00:26:16 so this this model won't be working. So this will give you the error. But if you see this documents, okay, the documents
00:26:22 we have, the books we have, if you extract all of the data, okay, so you you can consider each and every words,
00:26:28 it's a token. And if you count the token from the entire books, so definitely it would be more than okay. It would be
00:26:34 more than your uh 8,000. Okay. More than it would be 8,000. Definitely it would
00:26:40 be more than 8,000. Okay. So that time can I pass the uh entire let's say book
00:26:46 books data to the model to the LLM? Possible. Let's say if I'm using GPT4 that time is it possible guys? Tell me
00:26:53 definitely not possible because we can see the context window 8,192.
00:26:58 Okay. But if we if we use the entire books and if you if you see the uh token size it is like very huge. Okay. Which
00:27:06 is over capping over over let's say coming my context window. So that's why instead of giving the all of the
00:27:12 informations to the model at a one time what we'll be doing is we'll be creating a chunks. Chunks means the small small
00:27:18 part of the data. Okay. So there is a parameter called chunk size and chunks overlap. So based on that we'll try to
00:27:26 do the chunking. Let's say if chunk size is 1,000. So what will happen? It will try to count 1,000 tokens and it will
00:27:33 create a one chunk. Okay. Then again it will count 1,000 tokens and it will count another chunk. So that's how we'll
00:27:39 be creating multiple chunks. Okay, small small part. Let's say here I can draw. So here I can draw. Let's say this is
00:27:45 the entire documents you have. Okay, this is the entire documents you have.
00:27:51 Okay, now chunking means here it will create a small small part. So this will become your first chunks. This will
00:27:57 become your second chunks. This will become your third chunks. Okay. And
00:28:03 these are the chunks we'll try to use. Okay. Now we'll try to send this data to the LLM. Okay. To the LLM. Now if you if
00:28:11 you see the context window, let's say chunk size is 1,000. Okay. So each each and every chunks is having 1,000 token.
00:28:18 That means if my model uh model let's say input size is 8,000. Okay. So here
00:28:23 we are sending 1,000 token to the model. That means there is no problem with the input. Okay. So that that time actually
00:28:29 it will not throw any kinds of error. So this is the idea of using the chunking
00:28:34 approach guys in RG. So this is the main component of RG. So definitely you'll be learning whenever you will go through
00:28:40 the generative course. Okay. Each and everything I already explained in detail. Okay. So how things are working.
00:28:45 So mostly this is a practical implementation series. So I'm not going to go into the theory theory uh theory
00:28:50 into that. Okay. This is the idea. So here uh we'll do the chunking. So after the chunking guys what I will do I will
00:28:57 use a embedding model because this is a raw text right and we
00:29:04 can pass the raw text to the model for this we have to convert convert them to the numbers that means vectors. So for
00:29:10 vectors we use something called embeddings okay embedding model okay embedding model. So there are some
00:29:16 embedding models are available. Uh either you can uh use some paid embedding model. I can you either I can
00:29:24 uh either you can use some uh free embedding model which is available on the hugging face platform. So in this uh
00:29:29 demo guys I'm going to use uh open source embedding model from the hugging face called sentence transformer. Okay.
00:29:37 And if you want to use openi hugging face embedding uh sorry openi embedding model you can use that. Okay. It's up to
00:29:42 you. So once I I get the embedding model. So what I will do guys, I'll try to create the vector embedding.
00:29:50 Vector embedding.
00:29:56 Okay, vector embedding. So this this will return you the uh vectors of the text you are having. So let's say here
00:30:02 we are having a text, right? And we can't pass this raw text to the model. So we have to convert them to the
00:30:08 numbers. And this number is called vector embeddings. And we have to store this embeddings in a database. And we
00:30:14 call it as a vector database. So here we'll try to use pine cone. Okay. Pine cone vector
00:30:23 DB. Okay. Pine cone is a vector DB. It is running on cloud. Okay. So this is
00:30:28 this will become my knowledge base KB. Okay. KB means knowledge base. So here
00:30:34 all of the vector will try to store because why I'm using vector database because it is having something called
00:30:40 indexing and similarity search. So it can perform something called similarity search. You can do something called retriever operations here. So I already
00:30:47 explained the vector database uh theory in my GNI playlist. Okay, you can check it out. So this is what actually we use
00:30:54 instead of using any traditional relational database. Okay. Now here what we have to do, we have to connect the
00:31:00 large language model. So here let's say we are having our LLM.
00:31:05 Okay, we are having our LLM. So in case let's say we are using GPT model. You
00:31:10 can use any kinds of model. You can use llama. You can use mistral. Any kinds of model you can use. Okay. So I'll be
00:31:16 using the provider. So mostly I'll be using the openi provider and we'll be accessing the GPT model. If you want you
00:31:23 can also use grock provider. You can use something called open router. Open router also gives some free free model.
00:31:28 You can also utilize that. It's up to you. Okay. So u this model will try to
00:31:34 connect with the knowledge base. So that means what will happen? Let's say if user so let's say this is the user.
00:31:40 Okay. This is the user. If they're asking anything so let's say they're asking
00:31:48 one question. Let's say what is atne?
00:31:53 Okay. This is the question they're asking. So this question will go to the knowledge base first of all. Okay. knowledge base and knowledge base will
00:32:00 return some rank result. Okay, rank result. So it
00:32:06 will return something called rank result. Rank result. So there is a parameter
00:32:12 called K. If K is equal to three, it will return three relevant response. Okay, three relevant response. It will
00:32:18 do something called similarity search and the most similar answer it will try to return on this particular question.
00:32:24 Okay. And this will go to the LLM and LLM also will try to take the question as well from the uh user. Okay. So the
00:32:33 what is the question? Question is nothing but what is acne and your uh knowledge base is is giving the answer
00:32:40 that means some uh rank result. Okay that means now LLM has the context
00:32:46 context. Okay context of the question. So what is acne? Because acne okay what
00:32:52 is acne exactly? It is coming from the knowledge base that means your LM is already connected with the vector
00:32:57 database. Okay, it has all all the information about the acne. So, LM will try to process the question as well as
00:33:04 the answer. Okay, and this will give you something called the actual response that time. Okay, we call it as a actual
00:33:13 response. So, this is what we need to show the user. Okay, and this response will try to pick and show in the front
00:33:20 end. Okay. So for for the back end development we'll be also using the flask and for for the front end
00:33:26 development also we'll be using the flask. Here we'll try to add some HTML and CSS code. We'll try to create a
00:33:31 front end page. The user can do the chat operation that it will go in the back end and in the back end actually we'll
00:33:37 try to send the in the lm. Okay. So this is the entire process guys we'll be using in this particular development.
00:33:51 Yeah. So
00:33:57 [Music] see uh you can start from the playlist.
00:34:04 Okay. I have. So here is the generative playlist. So just try to complete it first of all. Uh then uh it would be
00:34:11 easy for you to develop these kinds of projects. Okay. Happy. Thanks for sharing your knowledge. You
00:34:18 do such a great job. Thank you so much.
00:34:23 Yeah. So guys, I think architecture wise it is clear. Okay. And this architecture we call it as rag. Okay. RG rag retal
00:34:31 augmented generation. Yeah. So here we are not fine-tuning the model. Instead of that we are creating a
00:34:38 knowledge base and this knowledge base we are giving to the model um as a custom data custom data source. Okay.
00:34:44 This is the idea and and nowadays whatever application you see over the internet whatever let's say new new
00:34:51 application comes all of the applications built up with this RG technique guys trust me all of the
00:34:57 application is built up with this RG technique and is in rag actually there are some different kinds of rags are
00:35:02 available okay so it's not like that you have to always use the same rag technique there are uh types of rag you
00:35:09 can use different types of rag you can use maybe in my uh YouTube channel I will also teach the different types of
00:35:15 rag you can implement. Okay. Yeah.
00:35:23 Fine. H and and uh nowadays people are also
00:35:28 using agents. Okay. AI agents uh in this uh rag as well. So we call it as a agentic rag. So I'll also show you how
00:35:36 we can develop that. Yeah. Now let's talk about the technology. the
00:35:41 technology we're going to use in this development. So take tech take tech take tech take tech take tech take stack.
00:35:49 So tech stack wise definitely uh programming language we'll be using Python
00:35:56 uh then uh we'll be using LLM. So LM wise we'll be using open AI
00:36:03 open AI GPT then orchestration framework wise we'll
00:36:08 be using langen to orchestrate the entire system
00:36:14 vector database wise we'll be using pine cone
00:36:19 then uh back end and front end development wise we'll be using flask
00:36:25 okay uh Yeah. And and and for the deployment we'll be using AWS.
00:36:33 Okay. Amazon Web Service. And here we'll try to deploy this project as a CI/CD.
00:36:40 CI/CD. Okay. CI/CD we'll try to deploy. Yeah. So this this is the entire take
00:36:46 guys we'll try to utilize inside our development. This is the idea.
00:36:54 H
00:37:03 okay now let me give you some brief idea about the deployment how how we are going to deploy the entire system
00:37:11 maybe I can give you some idea here so here guys we'll be uh creating the CI/CD
00:37:16 okay CI/CD approach so let's say here you you have your project code in the
00:37:22 GitHub
00:37:29 project code. Uh so here what will happen? Uh so let's
00:37:36 say this is the entire CI/CD pipeline. CICD
00:37:42 pipeline we'll try to implement this pipeline. Okay. So here we'll be using GitHub
00:37:49 actions for the CI/CD tool. Okay. So there is a tool called GitHub action.
00:37:56 So this is this tool. It will perform the trigger operation. Okay. So here what will happen? Uh we'll be using
00:38:03 something called AWS cloud. Okay. AWS cloud.
00:38:08 So here we'll try to use some service from the AWS cloud like we'll be using something called EC2.
00:38:15 EC2 EC2 instance. This is the virtual machine. Okay. Uh virtual machine. So in
00:38:22 this virtual machine we'll be executing our application. So that means what will happen if let's say you you as a
00:38:27 developer let's say this is you you are the developer uh whenever you are
00:38:32 committing your code to the GitHub so this this GitHub action will detect that okay detect if there there is a new
00:38:39 update or not if there is update so it will trigger the CI/CD let's say
00:38:45 pipeline and your entire source code will try to build as a docker image okay
00:38:51 uh entire uh uh let's say code will try to build as a docker image. So here we'll be using docker docker for that
00:38:58 and this image will try to save in a service called ECR. ECR elastic
00:39:04 container registry. So this is like a docker hub. Okay. So this image will store in the ECR and from the ECR we'll
00:39:10 try to pull this image to the EC2. Okay. And in the EC2 we'll do some port mapping.
00:39:16 Okay. We'll do some port mapping and after that this will release a IP
00:39:21 address. And in this IP address your application will run so that user can use your application. Okay, user can use
00:39:28 your application. So this is the entire idea. So that means it will be connected like that. Okay. So this is the entire CI/CD pipeline we'll try to develop
00:39:35 guys. It will be more clear whenever I will go go with the practical. So you I believe that you'll be able to
00:39:41 understand. Okay. Yeah.
00:39:47 All right. So now let's start the development. Okay. So, uh how we can
00:39:53 develop guys? First of all, uh here
00:39:58 the first thing we'll try to create the GitHub repo.
00:40:06 Every project it's a good practice to create a GitHub repo. Okay. Always because in industry people people use
00:40:13 GitHub. If you are working in a team so they would prefer to commit their code in the GitHub and to build the CI/CD we
00:40:19 also need the GitHub. So GitHub repo is important. After that we'll try to create the project
00:40:28 template that means folder structure. Then after that we'll try to do the project
00:40:35 setup. We'll try to create the virtual environment. We'll try to install the requirements. Okay. Package each and
00:40:41 everything. Then after that we'll try to do the notebook experiment.
00:40:51 Okay, Jupyter notebook experiment because uh it is a good practice before implementing the modular coding. First
00:40:57 of all try to experiment in the Jupyter notebook. If Jupyter notebook is working fine then try to convert it uh this
00:41:04 thing as a modular coding. Okay. Once Jupyter notebook is working, we'll try to create the modular coding.
00:41:12 modular code. Okay. So once modular code is
00:41:18 built, we'll try to create the app. Okay. Web app. So here I can write web
00:41:24 app and once web app is built, we'll try to
00:41:30 do the deployment deployment. Okay. So this is the entire
00:41:36 idea guys. So this step we'll try to follow one by one. So let's try to uh do the first step
00:41:43 GitHub repository creation. So before starting guys I I want the
00:41:48 confirmation from you. Are you ready guys? Let me know. Can I start?
00:41:54 Can I start? Are you ready? If you're ready, please give me a like any kinds of emoji in the chat chat so
00:42:00 that I can get the confirmation you are ready and I can start the development guys. please
00:42:09 and also hit the like uh in this session all of you and also hit the subscribe
00:42:14 button. Yeah.
00:42:31 Great. So, let's continue. So, I'll open up my GitHub. All of you, you can open up your GitHub accounts. Okay. All of
00:42:38 you, you can open up your GitHub accounts. Make sure you have the GitHub accounts. If you don't have, just try to
00:42:43 create it. Okay. Yeah. And after that, just try to click on the profile. Go to the repository
00:42:50 section. And here you will see one option called
00:42:56 new repository. Okay. So, just try to click here. So, here you can give the project name. So here I will try to give
00:43:04 uh what name I can give maybe I can use the
00:43:09 same session name. Okay, same session name maybe I can use.
00:43:16 So this is the name.
00:43:25 Okay. So after that let's keep it public because I want everyone uh you can
00:43:31 access this repo. I'll add the readmi file and get ignore. So here we are
00:43:36 using python programming language. So you have to search for the python and the license. Okay. You can take any
00:43:42 kinds of license. There are so many license are available. Uh so let's say I'll take this Apache license. Okay.
00:43:49 Yeah. So now let's create the repository guys.
00:43:55 Okay, I will also do that code with Romesh
00:44:02 Langraph series also. I'll try to start. No need to worry. Fine. So, my repository is created. Now, the second
00:44:09 step, we have to clone this repository in my local. How to clone? There is a button called code. Just try to click
00:44:15 here and copy this link address. Okay, make sure you copy this https link
00:44:20 address and open up your local folder. So here you can see I have a empty
00:44:26 folder. Inside that I'm going to open up my g bash. So here guys you need some
00:44:31 tool. Okay let me write what what are the tools you need. So here the first
00:44:36 tool you need the anaconda anaconda distribution. So I think all of you have the anaconda
00:44:42 guys let me know yes or no anaconda right. Then the second tool you need
00:44:47 something called G bash. GB bash.
00:44:54 Okay. And the third tool you need Microsoft VS code.
00:44:59 Yeah. So uh these three software you have to download. And how you can download? Just go to the Google and
00:45:05 search for let's say Anagonda. You need Anaconda. Just uh go to go to this link anagonda.com/d download/success. Okay.
00:45:13 If you open it up, so here you will be getting the link to download the Anagonda software. Let me show you. So
00:45:20 see, so here here is the free download. So you can either uh download for the Windows, Mac and Linux. Okay. So here if
00:45:27 you click so it will download and after that just try to do install it. Do next text next and install the software the
00:45:34 way you install any kinds of software. And once it is installed you can search for the Anagonda. You will see this
00:45:39 particular option called Anagonda prompt. Okay. Don't open the navigator. We don't use the navigator. We need the prompt. Okay. Now if I open the prompt
00:45:46 so that's how you'll be getting this particular prompt. Okay. Now here you can execute any kinds of cond command.
00:45:51 Okay. Cond related command you can execute. Okay. Yeah. Now the second tool
00:45:56 you need g. Uh so to install the g try try to search gm.
00:46:03 GM the first website open it up and download it. So those who are using Mac
00:46:09 OS I think you already have g installed in your terminal just try to
00:46:14 check just write g command if it is working that means you already have otherwise you can install it okay so for
00:46:20 windows guys you can uh download uh this exe file after that do next next install
00:46:25 it and once it is installed just search for the g here okay g so you'll see something called gb bash if I open it up
00:46:32 so this is my g bash and here I can execute any kind of g related commands Okay.
00:46:38 Yeah. So once it is done then you need something called VS code. So you can search for VS code download and open the
00:46:45 first website. Uh here is the VS code guys. Okay. So uh with respect to your
00:46:50 operating system just try to install it. So see Windows then uh Linux then Mac.
00:47:00 Okay. So click here. Do the next next. Okay. Install it. And once you install,
00:47:05 you can search for VS code. It would be available like that. Okay. Yeah. So try to install uh these three tools guys
00:47:12 because we need it. Uh so now right now what I will do I'll just try to go back to my local folder and here I'm going to
00:47:19 open up my git bash. Okay. How to open it up? Uh you can uh go to the show more option and you can see something called
00:47:26 uh this one. Uh see for me it is a little bit different because I integrated GBash in
00:47:32 my terminal. Okay, Windows Terminal. So there is a tool you'll be getting in Microsoft Store called Windows Terminal.
00:47:37 Okay, you can install it and you can also integrate your Git Bash with that. Okay, so I already integrated and how to
00:47:43 integrate for this you can take uh some help from the internet. So there are some tutorial you can follow to connect
00:47:48 your GitBash with your Windows terminal. So this this will give you some good-looking terminal. Okay, see uh uh
00:47:54 it's not like that you have to use this terminal. Okay, you can use it. If you want to customize your terminal, you can use it. Okay, for me I already did the
00:48:00 customization. That's why I got a good-looking terminal here.
00:48:06 Extremely sorry guys. Yeah. So if you want this kinds of good-looking terminal, you can install this Microsoft
00:48:14 terminal and here you can integrate multiple let's say uh terminal. Okay. Multiple let's say command prompt. You
00:48:21 can integrate here. So let's say in a single terminal I can open up my Anagonda. I can open up my uh Azure
00:48:29 shell. Okay. I can open up my Ubuntu let's say uh terminal. So in a single
00:48:35 one I can open any kinds of thing. So this is the convenient to use this Microsoft terminal. Okay. So let me
00:48:42 close all of them. I don't need Yeah, I I have my gbash here. Now here you have to write a command. Okay. What command?
00:48:48 The command is let me zoom my screen. I think you can see that. Get clone. Okay. Get clone. Now the link you have copied
00:48:55 from the GitHub, you have to paste it. How you can paste it? Just do the right click operation. Uh okay. So it is
00:49:01 showing so many option because uh I have to copy it again. So I'll go
00:49:07 back copy the link address. I'll open up my terminal and let's write the command
00:49:13 get clone paste it here. Yeah. So now if I hit ex uh enter now see this repo has
00:49:19 been cloned guys. Okay. This repo has been cloned. So maybe I can change the view. So see this repo has been cloned.
00:49:25 Now what you have to do? You have to go inside this particular folder. Now how we can go for this? Just write this
00:49:32 command cd and give the name of the folder. So the folder name is build a complete medical chatbot. So if you just
00:49:38 write B UI and press tab, it will autocomplete. Okay, you don't need to
00:49:44 even write everything. Just uh press tab it will autocomplete and press enter.
00:49:49 Now see you are inside this particular folder. Now you are inside this particular folder. Okay. Now if you want to see the content inside that, you can
00:49:55 use this ls command. Okay, ls means list everything inside that. So this is the convenient uh uh for this particular g
00:50:03 bash. Okay, you can execute bash script here. Okay, personally for the development I like bash script a lot
00:50:09 guys. Okay, so uh with a command actually you can create everything. You can execute everything. You can let's
00:50:14 say customize everything. All right. So that's why I I personally use git bash
00:50:20 for my development. So if you want you can also do the configuration like me. Okay. Now let me clear the terminal. So
00:50:26 here I can execute almost all kinds of Linux command. Okay. If you want to create a folder, I can use a touch
00:50:31 command. Uh sorry, if I want to create a file, I can use a touch command. If I want to create a folder, I can use MKD.
00:50:37 Okay. MKDR. So these are the Linux related command I can execute at the end. Okay. Uh yeah. And if you want to
00:50:44 learn Linux guys like how you can use Linux commands, okay. Uh in the
00:50:49 production environment, so for this I already created a MLOps playlist, MLOps uh video playlist. Okay. You can see
00:50:56 MLOps in one video. I think it's a 12 hours video. You can also go through that if you want to understand the uh
00:51:02 MLOps works. Okay. Let's say how you can use the uh Linux, how we can use the G
00:51:07 and GitHub. Okay. And everything I have already discussed here. Okay. Yeah. So here I'm showing you the actual
00:51:12 development. Okay. How things works. So uh I I can also create everything manually. I can open my command prompt
00:51:19 but I'm not using that because I I want to give you the actual development flavor. Okay. Yeah. my my personal test
00:51:26 actually I want to share with you that's why I'm using this kinds of tools guys fine all right so now I I want to open
00:51:33 up my visual code studio in this particular directory okay now how to open it up just do the right click uh
00:51:39 click on show more options and here you will see something called open the VS code let's open up my VS code here okay
00:51:46 now I'll zoom little bit because I want everyone to see that
00:51:51 yeah I think my screen is visible. Okay. And recently the uh in the new VSS code
00:51:58 you will see they have added something called copilot. I think you have used something called
00:52:04 cursor ID guys. Okay. Cursor ID. In cursor ID also you will be getting this
00:52:09 kinds of uh AI uh AI integrated that means AI assistant integrated. So here if you give any kinds of command it will
00:52:16 uh let's say uh do do the work with respect to that. Let's say if you give I want I want to create a folder or let's
00:52:23 say I want to create a file or let's say debug my code generate a code everything it can do. So this particular
00:52:29 functionality that means the copilot functionality they have also added here. Okay. Now uh I think uh this is some of
00:52:37 the model they will give for the free but if you want to use it uh for the let's say pro level at that time I maybe
00:52:43 you have to subscribe their subscription plan. Okay but we don't need the co-pilot we'll try to remove this. Yeah.
00:52:49 So this is my visual code studio.
00:52:56 All right. So successfully we have created our GitHub repo and uh we opened
00:53:03 it with our VS code. Now the next thing we'll try to create the project template right now. Okay. So project template
00:53:09 either you can create manually. So there you can see the file option, folder option. You can click here you can create the folder structure manually.
00:53:16 But I I feel like uh manual creation is uh always a hard task because you have
00:53:22 to create manually. Let's say you need multiple folders and file. You have to do again and again the same thing. Uh so
00:53:28 what I usually do, I use something called bash script to create my
00:53:33 folder stacks here. Okay. Either you can use the Python script, either you can use the bash script. Okay. So let me
00:53:39 show you how I use the bash script. So for this I'll create a file here called template.
00:53:47 SH okay template HS file inside that I'm going to write my bash script to create my folder structure okay so let me write
00:53:56 so here uh first of all I want to create a um src folder for this this is the
00:54:02 command I'm going to use mk uh mkdir sorry mk
00:54:10 dir that means make make directory now you have to give the
00:54:16 uh hyphen pameter and you have to give the folder name. So the folder name I want to use called src.
00:54:24 Okay, src. Then the second folder I want to create something called resource. So again what
00:54:30 I can do I can use the same command uh only the name would be different. So
00:54:37 research research. Okay. Yeah. Now inside the
00:54:46 folder. Okay. So here I can maybe make a comment just to make you understand. So
00:54:52 here I'm creating directories. Okay.
00:54:59 Directory. And here I'll be creating the file.
00:55:07 Creating files. Okay. Now to create the file this is the command. You can use the touch command. Okay. Touch. Now what
00:55:13 file you want to create and in which folder? Let's say I want to create a file inside src folder. Okay. So I'll
00:55:19 give the folder location src uh / the file name. First of all I'll be
00:55:24 creating a constructor file called init_.py. Then I'm going to create another file
00:55:31 inside the same folder called touch uh src/
00:55:38 the file name should be helper.py. Okay. Then I'm going to create another
00:55:43 file inside that called prom.py.
00:55:51 Okay, prom.py. Then I need another file called env
00:55:57 because here I'm going to mention my uh environment secret. Let's say I want to use the open AI model for this. I need
00:56:03 open AI secret. I need I I I want to use pine cone. I need pine cone secret. So
00:56:08 to manage that I need this env file. Okay. Then uh I also need something
00:56:14 called setup file. So touch setup.py. Then I need something called app.py. So
00:56:21 touch app.py. Okay. Then I need something called uh experiment file inside my
00:56:28 research. So what I can do? I can again write touch uh research. Okay. Inside research I
00:56:36 want to create something called trials
00:56:43 trials okay dot ipnb notebook file then I also want to create
00:56:50 a requirements file okay touch requirements txt then uh I need um what I need
00:57:02 I need another file Uh okay. So as of now uh
00:57:08 uh I'm not able to get what file I need but later on if I need anything else I'll try to create. Okay. So once
00:57:13 everything is created I will give a terminal message. I'll just give a eco command. So here I'll give a message
00:57:20 like directory and files created successfully. Okay. So this is the message I'm going to give. Fine. So this
00:57:27 is my bash script guys I have written. Now if I want to execute this bash script. So make sure you open up your GB
00:57:34 bash. Okay, you open up your G bash. So those uh who are already using Mac OS or
00:57:39 Linux. So they don't need to uh use the G bash because you already have the bash bash terminal with you. So you can
00:57:46 execute this command called hs and the file name. So template hs. Okay. Now see
00:57:52 the magic guys. Left hand side I don't have anything. Now if I execute automatically the folder structure would be created. So see guys, my folder
00:57:59 structure got created. Now you can see so this is the folder resource inside that I created this uh trials.pipv file
00:58:07 it is available now src is a folder inside that I have this three file in it helper prompt okay now this is my nv
00:58:14 file and app.py requirement txt setup.py each and everything is there. Okay. So
00:58:20 that's how I always like to create this kinds of files and folder in an automated way. Okay. Yeah.
00:58:29 Yeah. Hi Christian. Hello. Hello. I hope you got it guys. Okay. How we can
00:58:34 create the folder structure. Okay. With the help of bash script.
00:58:40 H. Now let's commit the changes in my GitHub. So I'll open up the terminal.
00:58:46 Let's clear it.
00:58:53 Okay. Yeah. Now here uh to commit to the
00:59:00 GitHub first of all uh do the adding st. So
00:59:06 just write g add space dot. Okay. So you you are uh giving
00:59:13 everything in the stinging area. After that you have to do the commit. So get commit
00:59:19 m. So here I can write folder structure
00:59:25 structure uh addit
00:59:30 then I'll do the push operation. So get push origin
00:59:36 main. So this is my main branch you can see. Okay. Now if I execute so it should
00:59:42 push everything. Yeah. Done. Now if I clear now if I go to the my
00:59:48 uh GitHub let me close these other tab not required.
00:59:56 Now if I refresh so see guys my uh folder structure is
01:00:02 updated here. Okay. Now this is the URL guys I'm giving in the chat so that
01:00:08 everyone can get the code from here. Okay. Even I will also add this link in my description section. Okay. after the
01:00:13 session. From there you can get it.
01:00:34 All right.
01:00:41 Okay. So that means now this step is also complete. Project template. Okay.
01:00:49 So this step is also complete. Now let's try to create uh uh complete the third one project setup. Now we'll try to do
01:00:57 the project setup. So first of all uh here you have to create a virtual environment guys. uh this is recommended
01:01:03 if you're starting any project instead of doing everything in the base environment because if I show you my
01:01:09 base environment if I just write let's say pip list so there are so many package already installed in my base
01:01:15 environment but I don't want them okay all of them and uh there is a specific
01:01:20 Python version also in the base environment see these are the package we I already have and now if I show you the
01:01:25 Python version so this is uh 3.12 but let's say you want to use any other
01:01:31 Python version. So how to do that? So for this you have to create a virtual
01:01:37 environment and for this let me share you the command you can follow to create the virtual environment.
01:01:45 Uh so here is the step. Okay here is the step. So
01:01:53 first step just try to clone my repo guys. Uh if you are following my uh code
01:01:59 just try to clone my repo. uh here you can give the repo link. So maybe I can provide the repo link here. So here I'll
01:02:06 copy the co link and let me just replace it here.
01:02:13 So this is the ripple link you can clone. Then after that uh here I can write the
01:02:21 command get clone. Okay, get clone this link. Then uh the step you have to
01:02:27 create the virtual environment. Okay. And this is the command to create the virtual environment. Okay. So here you
01:02:33 have to execute contact create uh hyphen in okay uh medbot. So here the name of
01:02:40 the environment I'm giving medbot. You can give any kinds of name. It's up to you. And the python version I'm using
01:02:45 3.10. You can also use 3.11 12. Okay. It's up to you. So this is the command you have to copy and you have to
01:02:51 execute. So let me first of all check whether I have this environment or not. So cond
01:02:58 NV list. So medbot yeah it is already there. I
01:03:04 already created that. So I'm not going to create it again guys. Okay. But if you don't have create it okay just try
01:03:10 to execute this command. First of all all of you execute this command. Okay.
01:03:16 So once you execute it your environment would be created. After that you have to activate the environment. Okay. How to
01:03:22 activate? This is the command. So copy the command and execute it here. Now see
01:03:27 previously it was base now it has activated with my medbot. Got it? So for
01:03:32 me I already have the environment because I already created this environment uh before the session. Okay.
01:03:38 Yeah. And I already activated. Now let me clear the terminal.
01:03:47 Fine. So once uh you have created the environment successfully now you have to
01:03:52 install the requirements. Now you need some requirement package to implement this project. I think I you remember I I
01:03:59 written the tech stack right? So I I written a tech stack here. So you need uh some uh package like clang chain uh
01:04:07 pine cone flask right. So let me mention all of the in the requirements. So here what I'll do I'll uh write everything in
01:04:15 my requirements. So first thing guys I need uh
01:04:20 langen as orchestration framework. So let me
01:04:25 lchen and here I'm going to use a specific
01:04:31 version of langen. So here I'll be using 0.3.26.
01:04:36 Okay. Uh now you can ask me why this version because uh this is the stable version uh uh I
01:04:44 usually use because here you will be getting um you you won't be getting any kinds of error because the project I
01:04:51 have designed I created with this langen version. Okay. So that's why I'm using this particular langen. You can also use
01:04:57 the updated one but what happens if you're using updated one sometimes there would be some dependency added. So it's
01:05:03 better to use any older version. uh older version is always stable that's why I'm using the older version then I
01:05:09 need uh the flask okay to create my front end and back end and here I'll be
01:05:16 using a specific version so I'll be using something called 3.1
01:05:23 one this version then after that I need sentence transformer because I told you
01:05:29 we'll be using the opensource embedding model which is available in the hugging face for is you need this library
01:05:35 sentence transformer and I'll be using this specific version called 4
01:05:42 1.0. Okay. After that I need uh pi PDF
01:05:49 because we'll be loading the PDF documents. So for this we need this package pi PDF and again I'm going to
01:05:54 use a specific version. So 5.6 1. Okay. So it's a good practice guys
01:06:03 just try to mention the version of the package. So let's say you are executing the project after two month after 1
01:06:09 month. So uh you will be installing the same version and you can execute the project otherwise what will happen this
01:06:15 uh package will updated and you will be getting a dependency error and the same thing people already got in my previous
01:06:20 implementation I did right so that's why it's better to use my uh uh it's better to use the specific version of the
01:06:27 package okay always and you can also share the version with your other developers. So they can install and they
01:06:32 can execute your project okay without having any kinds of error. Now I I need the pythonv to manage my in env file. So
01:06:40 here I can write and I need a specific version. So 1.1.0
01:06:47 okay then uh I need the pine cone. Okay. And pine cone is already available inside langen. So I can install like
01:06:54 that. So, Langchen Langchain
01:07:00 Pine Cone. Okay. And I want to install a specific
01:07:07 version 0 2.8. Then I need uh Langchen OpenAI because
01:07:15 we'll be using the OpenAI model from the Langen. And here I'm going to
01:07:21 install this version 0 3
01:07:26 24. Then I need langen community as well because this community you need
01:07:34 for as a dependency. So langen community and again I'm going to install a specific version 0.3
01:07:43 26 I can use. Yeah. And uh for the setup.py pi file I need to add this
01:07:50 command hyphen e space dot okay
01:07:56 yeah now in the setup.py Pi you can mention the setup related code. So let
01:08:02 me import. So from setup tool uh import
01:08:09 I need find packages and I need something called setup. Okay.
01:08:15 Yeah. Then after that here I'm going to initialize the setup.
01:08:26 So inside that I'm going to first of all mention the name of the project. So medical chatbot. Then the version of the
01:08:33 project. Let's say this is 0.1.0. And uh the author name. So author name
01:08:39 maybe I can give my name. Uh dear
01:08:46 Amed. By the way, I'm using copilot in my VS code. That's why it's giving me the code
01:08:52 suggestion. Okay. Yeah. Then I I I have to mention the
01:08:58 author email. So here I can give my email entgmail.com.
01:09:11 Then after that I can mention this packages is equal to find package. So
01:09:16 what it will do? It will try to find this constructor file. So wherever it will see the constructor file this
01:09:22 folder uh it will install as a local package. Okay. Um yeah now there is
01:09:27 another parameter you have to mention called install requires and this should be empty. Okay. So it
01:09:33 will automatically take all of the um all of the let's say requirements from
01:09:39 the requirements and it will try to install them. Okay. Yeah. So this is my setup uh setup.py. Okay. And this will
01:09:46 help you to install any kinds of folder as a local package because here we'll be following the modular coding. We'll try
01:09:52 to import some function from different different module. Right? For this the setup.py is required. Yeah. Now let me
01:09:58 save everything and we'll try to install the requirement now. So for this this is
01:10:03 the command p installer requirement.txt. I'll copy and let's execute it here.
01:10:11 So see for me uh it is already done because uh previously I already installed everything the dependency uh
01:10:17 it's completed for me but for you it will take some time. Okay. Yeah. So yeah I think everything
01:10:25 is fine. Setup.py
01:10:35 Yeah. So okay one thing uh there should not be any space. Okay. hypen space dot
01:10:42 hyen space dot. Now let me execute the requirements file again.
01:10:49 Yeah, now you can see one egg info file has created. That means your setup uh tool has been installed successfully.
01:10:56 Okay. Fine. Now let me clear the terminal.
01:11:04 So I believe guys still here you understood everything. let me know.
01:11:11 Okay. So now let's let's uh commit the changes. See I can also commit from my VS code. Uh so here I can give let's say
01:11:19 requirements add it
01:11:25 seeing the changes. So it will automatically push everything in my GitHub.
01:11:30 Now if I show you so if I go to my GitHub refresh.
01:11:35 So see everything is available here. Now you can copy the command and you can use
01:11:41 it
01:11:54 H.
01:12:02 All right. So that means my this part is also ready. Project setup is also ready.
01:12:09 Okay. Now let's do the notebook experiment. Okay. First of all, we'll try to create the entire project on my
01:12:16 Jupyter notebook. Uh then once uh I I if I feel like okay everything is working
01:12:22 then I'll try to uh start the modular coding and web app then deployment. Okay, this is the idea. So for this so
01:12:29 what I will do I'll just try to close these are the file
01:12:34 here. Now here you remember I think I created a notebook file inside resource folder. Let's open it up. Let's take
01:12:41 some code cell and I have to select my terminal. Okay that uh sorry select my
01:12:47 environment I created. So uh click on select kernel Python environment and
01:12:53 here you will see the medbot. Okay I'll try to select this one. Now just for testing I'll give a print message.
01:13:02 Print. Okay. So yeah. So everything is working fine.
01:13:08 All right.
01:13:18 H. Now let's start the development guys. Okay. So I'll I'll uh do everything in
01:13:23 the Jupyter notebook. Yeah.
01:13:28 Uh so first of all I need the data. Okay. I need the data. So let's let's
01:13:33 create a folder here. I'm going to name it as data. Inside that I'm going to
01:13:38 move my PDF documents. I have this medical uh books. I'll copy and in the
01:13:46 data folder I'll try to paste it. I'll also share this uh books with you guys in my GitHub. You can uh take it from
01:13:52 there. So this is the PDF documents I have. But currently if I show you my
01:13:58 project working directory. Okay. If I show you my project working directory PWD.
01:14:06 So I'm inside the resource folder. Okay. I'm inside the resource folder which is this folder right now. But my data it is
01:14:13 present inside the data folder. That means out of the resource folder. Okay. So if I want to uh load the data first
01:14:20 of all I have to get back uh to the project directory that means in this directory
01:14:26 okay in this directory then I'll be able to access the data for this what I can do I can use a command
01:14:33 so import operating system and inside there is a function
01:14:39 called chdir. Now inside that you have to give uh dot
01:14:44 dot slash. Okay, dot dot slash means you want to get back one folder back. Okay, now if I execute and again if I show you
01:14:51 my project working directory. Now see guys, I'm inside my root folder right now. Project working folder. Previously
01:14:57 I was in the research but right now I'm inside my project folder. Okay, now I can easily load the data right now. But
01:15:04 before that I need to import some library. So I need
01:15:09 uh PDF loader from the lang. So I'll just import langen langchen
01:15:15 dot documents loader. Okay. Import
01:15:23 uh pi pdf pi pdf loader
01:15:31 and the directory loader as well. Okay. Then I need from langen
01:15:39 dot text splitter I need recursive character text splitter for the chunking operation. Okay. So
01:15:46 recursive character text splitter. Yeah. So let me import them. Now here I'm
01:15:52 going to create a function to load my PDF. So let's create a function. So extract
01:15:58 text from PDF files. So def uh load
01:16:06 load and load.
01:16:11 Let me just uh give it as load PDF files. Okay.
01:16:18 PDF files.
01:16:23 Now it will take the PDF path that is the data path and what it will do it
01:16:29 will try to load it. So loader is equal to uh directory loader
01:16:37 and inside that you have to give the data that means the path of the PDF okay
01:16:45 and you have to also mention uh globe okay globe parameter because I
01:16:51 want to only load the PDF okay not any other file so here I can give like that
01:16:56 so dot PDF only okay so in this directory in the data folder. So, uh if
01:17:02 you have multiple PDF also, it will try to load that. Okay. So, let's say you want to use uh three books that time you
01:17:08 can keep three books here and give the data folder location. It will try to load all of the PDF file. So, because
01:17:13 here you have mentioned PDF, okay, it should load all of the PDF. Okay, dot PDF file and loader class I have given
01:17:21 pi PDF loader because this is a PDF documents and to load it I need PI PDF loader from the langen. Okay, that's it.
01:17:28 So once my loader is ready. So here now I can load it easily. So documents is equal to loader.load. Once it is loaded
01:17:35 I'll try to return it. So return documents. Okay that's it. Now let me test whether it's working or not. So
01:17:41 here I can write extracted extracted
01:17:49 uh data is equal to load PDF files. And here I'm going to give my
01:17:56 data path. Okay, this folder path and now it should load the data. So let me
01:18:01 execute.
01:18:12 So this is a very big page right a very big book. So that's why it's taking some time to load the data. Now if I show you
01:18:19 this extracted data. Now see guys uh all of the page it has loaded. Okay. And the
01:18:25 format is document format because langen always written document format. Okay. So all of the page guys it has loaded.
01:18:32 Okay. All of the page it has loaded. Now how many page you have here. You can also see the length.
01:18:38 So here I can show you the length of extracted data. So 637. So maybe you can see we
01:18:46 also have 637 pages. Okay. Yeah. So that means perfectly we're able to load all
01:18:52 of the uh pages. Now these pages has some uh other information as well like meta
01:18:58 information like producer creator time. Okay. Then uh mod date source total
01:19:05 pages. Okay. Page label then the page content. Okay. So here this is the important things space content because
01:19:11 page content is having all of the information. So I don't need all of these metadata. I I need maybe some of
01:19:16 the metadata. Maybe let's say I need the uh source like what is the source of this PDF and the and the and the page
01:19:24 content. Okay. So for this I I will do a filter operation. Okay. I'll do a filter operation. So let's do a filter
01:19:30 operation. So let's create a function. So for this I'm going to import some library.
01:19:35 Import typing import list. Then I need
01:19:40 something called langen schema documents. Okay. So, langen dot schema
01:19:47 import documents. So, here I'm going to create a function called filter
01:19:54 to minimal docs. Minimal
01:20:01 docs. So, this will take your let me show you guys. Uh this is the function.
01:20:09 Okay. This is the function. So this will take the entire documents okay and it will only return this source
01:20:17 and the p content of the source okay because I don't need all of the information okay all of the information
01:20:23 it is not required for your um project now let me show you the output so I will
01:20:29 call this minimal docs is equal to
01:20:36 filter to minimal docs and here I'll give my extra racted data. Now if I
01:20:41 execute now see guys here it will only return me the source and the past
01:20:48 content. Source the past content. Okay because I already get rid of everything which is unnecessary here. Okay. So
01:20:56 that's how you can do some filter operation guys. You you you have to make your data clean.
01:21:02 Yeah
01:21:07 sir. Uh can we implement this same system for the college chatbot? Yes, you can do it. Uh what is the minimal
01:21:13 hardware requirement for this system will work for GPU RTX30? Uh yes system
01:21:18 requirement wise uh if you also have CPU system it will work because here we are using uh open AI provider. Okay, we are
01:21:26 not using any open source LLM uh which is downloading from the hugging face. Uh open source LM LM will be using the
01:21:32 embedding model only. So if you don't have GPU also it will work fine. Namaste sir sir I want to make my career in
01:21:39 computer vision related technology how should I move ahead to the knowledge like you please provide a detailed road map please uh yeah Manisha for this
01:21:47 start uh watching my computer vision playlist okay so there I already given
01:21:52 you some road map what are the things you should know to start with the computer vision career okay and if you
01:21:57 need any personal guidance just try to reach out to my LinkedIn profile yeah so guys uh my filter is done now what I
01:22:05 will do okay Now what I will do because uh yeah so data data load is done. We
01:22:10 have uh successfully extracted the data. So if I show you this architecture so we
01:22:15 had the PDF book. We extracted all of the um documents. Now we'll do the chunking operation. Okay. So let's do
01:22:22 the chunking. So for this let's create a function. Before that I'll try to comment. So split
01:22:31 split the documents into the smaller chunks. So def
01:22:37 uh text split. Let's name it as
01:22:44 split. So it will take my minimal docs
01:22:50 and it will do the chunking operation. Okay. So how to perform the chunking? So
01:22:55 this is the code. So recursive character test splitter. I think remember we imported and here we're giving the chunk
01:23:01 size. Okay. So let's give the chunk size is equal to 500. that means 500 tokens it will consider as a one chunks and
01:23:07 here you have to give the chunks overlap. So let's give 20. So there there there are some overlap value you
01:23:12 also need to give because uh it will understand the context okay with that. Then uh here you have to p uh remove it.
01:23:21 I don't need it. Yeah. Then text splitter split documents. Here you have to give the minimal docs and it will
01:23:26 return the chunk text. Okay. So here I can write uh it will return me something called text chunks.
01:23:34 chunk. Okay, text chunk. So I'll try to return it. That's it. Now let me call the function.
01:23:41 So here text chunk
01:23:47 is equal to text split. Inside that I'll pass my minimal docs.
01:23:53 Okay. And this will give you the chunks. So let me print the number of chunks I
01:23:59 got here. Okay. Um yeah. So now let me execute.
01:24:05 So see guys here I got five 5,859 chunks. Okay. So if you want to see all
01:24:11 of the chunks you can also print it. So see guys this is the chunks you got. Now
01:24:17 this documents has uh converted as a chunks okay small
01:24:22 chunks and each chunks will have 500 tokens. Okay. Because you have mentioned here.
01:24:28 Okay. Now I can easily pass this data to my model. But before that what I have to do I have to do the embeddings. Okay.
01:24:34 Now here you can see guys uh I have to use the embedding model to generate the vector embedding. That vector embedding
01:24:40 we'll try to store in the knowledge base. So let's get the ve uh embedding model first of all. So for this I'll be
01:24:46 using lang uh uh hugging face embedding model. So let's import it. So from lang
01:24:53 chain lang chain uh embeddings. Okay. uh import
01:25:01 hugging face embeddings. Okay, I'll try to import it. Now let's write write a function. So download
01:25:10 download uh embedding.
01:25:15 So here I will give the model name.
01:25:21 So this is the model guys I'm going to use.
01:25:28 So sentence transformer all mini LM L6 V2. Uh so this is embedding model and it
01:25:34 returns 384 dimensional dense vector. Okay. So let's try to load this model.
01:25:39 So here I have to give the model name. Yeah. So now uh embedding is equal to
01:25:44 hugging face embedding model name. Uh and this things I don't need to pass.
01:25:49 Okay. Yeah. Now it should download the model from the hugging face hub. So let's try
01:25:56 to download it. So embedding
01:26:02 is equal to download embedding. Now let's execute. So see guys, it is downloading the model from the hugging
01:26:08 face app. What is the size of the model? You can also see here. You can go to the files
01:26:15 and version. So it's around I think uh
01:26:20 3 to 400 MB. Okay. Now it is getting downloaded. So see it it got downloaded
01:26:26 okay for me and this is the object of the embedding model okay so this is the
01:26:32 model now let's test this model whether it's what uh works or not so for this
01:26:40 uh I will uh use this embedding model and let's do a embed query operation
01:26:48 here I will give a sentence let's I'll give um
01:26:53 Hello uh world. Okay. And this will return you some vectors. So
01:27:02 vector. Now let's print the vector as well.
01:27:08 So this is the vector guys you can see. Okay. Uh this this is this sentence and this is the vector representation of
01:27:14 this sentence. Now if you want to see the dimension so you can also see the dimension. So print
01:27:21 uh vector length length of the vector. So see it's 384 dimensional vector. The
01:27:28 things they have also mentioned in the model card. See okay. And this is completely open
01:27:35 source uh embedding model. Now you can also use any uh hugging face embedding model. You can also use any other
01:27:41 embedding model from any other provider. It's up to you. You already know about the basics. Okay. How we can load different different model from with the
01:27:47 help of this langjet. It's possible.
01:27:56 Yeah. I I used because uh see then embedding model is costly. So if you're
01:28:01 using open embedding model and if you convert uh all of the text from this given book
01:28:08 so it will charge you more. So that's why I thought let's use free embedding model so that you won't be having charge
01:28:14 in your account. Okay that's why.
01:28:23 Yeah.
01:28:32 Okay. So now uh what I will do guys, I'll try to um
01:28:38 store this uh vector to the pine cone vector database. Okay. And for this you
01:28:45 need uh the pine cone um index that means in pine cone you have to create a
01:28:51 cluster. So let's open up our pine cone because pine cone runs on cloud. You have to search like that pine cone.io.
01:28:59 This is the website. Let's log in with my account. So make sure first of all you have to
01:29:04 create a account guys. Okay just try to sign up and with your Gmail just try to create a account. For me I already have
01:29:09 the account. So I'll try to log in.
01:29:17 So, I'll log in with my Google account. So, let's see. Let my email.
01:29:31 What about images are we embed those only text? No. See here images is not
01:29:37 required. So, this see images is not required. So, here I need the information. I need the diagnosis. I
01:29:43 need the disease. I need the medicine. Image is is not required. Nikl. Okay.
01:29:48 Yeah. But I will also show you another project. So there uh I I will also show you let's say in a PDF if you also have
01:29:55 some meaningful image, meaningful uh tables, meaningful graph. So how you can
01:30:01 uh create a rag on top of that. You can also take those image, you can also take those graph and you can also convert it
01:30:06 to the number. I will also show you that part. Okay? But this project we don't need the image. We only need the text. Got it.
01:30:13 Yeah. So here uh what I will do uh here uh let's try to um uh create a index.
01:30:22 This is my account. I'll create a index. So you don't need to create the index either you can also create a manually.
01:30:29 Uh either you can create a programmatically. Okay. So here uh we are using uh Python programming. So
01:30:34 everything we'll try to create a programmatically. Okay. We are not going to create manually here. So see uh initially I I uh I have one index
01:30:42 running uh uh because this is another project actually I developed. So let's create a new index but for you it would
01:30:48 be completely empty if you're logging for the first time guys. Okay.
01:30:53 We'll be deploying on the AWS. Yeah. Uh so first of all you need the uh pine
01:30:59 cone API key. So where you will get the API key? So left hand side you will see there is a option called API key. Just try to click here and here you can
01:31:07 create a API key. Let's create API key. I'll give let's say medical bot
01:31:14 uh create the key. So this is my key. I'll copy and I will
01:31:20 try to mention in myv file. So here you have to write like that
01:31:26 pine cone
01:31:32 pine cone API key. So here I'll try to paste my API key. So make sure guys you
01:31:37 use your API key. Okay, don't use my API key because I I'm going to remove after the session. And here you also need to
01:31:44 mention your open API key. So open AI API key. So let me mention my open API key.
01:32:00 I already created my open APK guys. I'm not going to show you because people will use that. Let me quickly add it.
01:32:10 So this is my open API key guys. Okay, let me save it.
01:32:16 Now I will go back and load it here. So I think you got it guys. How to create
01:32:22 the pine cone API key. Okay, and you have to mention in the file. Now I have to load it with my pythoni
01:32:30 install. I think remember here python.enb with the help of that we'll try to load it. So how to load it? So
01:32:36 first of all you have to import it. So from env import load env
01:32:42 you you also need operating system then load env. Okay. So this will load your
01:32:48 env file. Then you can access this credential. Okay. So for this you can write this code. So python uh I'll open
01:32:57 it up. Pine cone API key
01:33:04 is equal to west.get env pine cone API key. Okay. And similar
01:33:10 wise I also need my open AIP key.
01:33:18 Open AIP. Okay. Yeah. So once I got
01:33:23 everything I also need to set as a environment variable. How to set? Just write this comm.inviron
01:33:33 uh pine cone API key and pine cone API key.
01:33:39 Then I will also do it for my open AI as well. So open a API key,
01:33:46 open a API key. Okay. So once everything is ready now
01:33:51 let me execute. Yeah. So it is set already. Now let me import the pine cone. Okay.
01:34:00 So from pine cone.
01:34:05 Okay. Import
01:34:10 pine cone. Then here you have to pass the pine cone API key. So, pine cone
01:34:19 pine cone uh API
01:34:27 key is equal to the pine cone API key
01:34:33 pine cone. It should be pine cone. Yeah. Then I'll try to
01:34:40 I'll try to first of all authenticate my pine cone account. So for this you have
01:34:46 to write this code. So pine cone client you have to initialize the pine cone client
01:34:52 and you have to give the API key here. So API key is equal to by pine cone API key. Okay. So if you execute this code
01:34:59 it will authenticate with your pine cone account. So this should be executed perfectly guys.
01:35:06 Okay. uh if it is not executing perfectly that means there is some issue with your API key. Okay. So for me it
01:35:12 has executed successfully. Now here what I'll do I'm going to create a index there. That means I'm going to create a
01:35:17 database. So for this let's import pine cone
01:35:23 uh import serverless. So this is the update guys. Okay. So
01:35:29 those who have already watched my previous implementation uh so there I was using in a different
01:35:35 way. Maybe I was using something called pine cone environment also. But now right now this this has been changed. So
01:35:41 you have to import something called serverless serverless specification. Then you have to give the index name. So
01:35:47 index name is equal to so let's say index name I'm going to give medical
01:35:52 chatbot. So once uh it is ready now let's create the index. So for this I'm going to write a condition if
01:36:00 uh not my pine cone client
01:36:05 uh pine cone client doesn't have any index. Okay that time I will pass my
01:36:11 index name then let's create it. So PC
01:36:18 dot create index inside that you have to give the
01:36:24 you have to give the index name
01:36:30 name is equal to index name then you have to me uh specify the dimension okay dimension of the vector so right now the
01:36:38 embedding model we're using called sentence transformer and it returns 384 dimensional vector I think you already s
01:36:44 saw that Right. So here I think you remember. So this is the vector size
01:36:51 384. So this dimension you have to provide here. Okay. Then you have to give the matrix the similarity matrix
01:36:58 you want to use here. So I'm going to use something called cosine. Okay. Cosine matrix. I'm going to use
01:37:04 cosine similarity. Uh then uh you have to specify the
01:37:10 specification. So spec is equal to server le specification. Uh so cloud I'm
01:37:17 going to use uh AWS and region I'm going to use uh US east one. So US east one.
01:37:27 Yeah. So once it is done now let's let's uh
01:37:32 create the index. So index is equal to uh PC.index and index name. Okay. Okay.
01:37:40 So there is a error I'm getting. The error is uh okay I have to give a comma here. Yeah. Now fine. Now let me save.
01:37:46 Now see guys here it will create a index for you. Okay. It will create a index for you. See in the in the database. And
01:37:52 this is the free tire. So here you will be getting storage is equal to 2GB. And this is the RUS and W's. Okay. And if
01:37:59 you need some more let's say powerful uh or let's say if you want to store some more vectors that time you can
01:38:04 upgrade their plan. But this is fine for us.
01:38:10 Okay. So now I think uh we are ready to create the index. Now let me execute.
01:38:18 So it should successfully create the index. But there is a error. Invalid matrix cosine must be cosine.
01:38:25 Okay. So cosine I think spelling is not correct. Let me check.
01:38:30 Uh yeah cosine. Okay. Sorry. It should be cosine. Now if I execute it should
01:38:35 create again one error pine cone object no
01:38:41 attribute index. Uh okay I think I should be capital
01:38:50 H. Now index is created. Now if I come here if I refresh.
01:38:57 So see guys my medical chatbot index has created and it is running. Now if I click here. So see it is running guys
01:39:04 and currently there is no records now uh because we haven't pushed any records yet. Okay, now we have to push the
01:39:10 records. How to decide what would be the best
01:39:15 vector dimensions for any use case? Uh see uh always if vector dimension is uh
01:39:22 high that means there are more information in the vector. So if you are if you're using open AAI embedding model
01:39:29 so that time vector dimension will increase that means it has more depth
01:39:35 information about the data. So definitely uh uh the higher dimensional
01:39:40 uh embedding model would be better instead of using the lower dimensional. Okay but we got stuck that if possible
01:39:48 to make learn only the format structure of the documents like a level of letter or content.
01:39:54 Okay. So just say what DV chroma pine con see what embedding method please see
01:40:00 uh you can use any embedding embedding method okay it doesn't matter with any kinds of vector vector database
01:40:07 okay you can I either use chromadv I can use pine cone I can use web I can use files it's completely up to you so here
01:40:13 I'm using pine cone because I love the pine cone it has one beautiful web interface you can also visualize your vector so yeah so that's why I'm using
01:40:20 you can also use chromad chrom is it's the local one you you have to execute in the local. Yeah. So that's why.
01:40:41 All right, guys.
01:40:54 Okay. So my index is created. Now we are ready to store our vector. Okay. Now let's try to store our vector. So for
01:41:01 this uh I will write the code.
01:41:07 So first of all let's import. So from langen
01:41:14 langchen pine cone uh import
01:41:19 uh pine cone vector store. Okay. So there is a function called pine cone vector store. I have to import it. Then
01:41:26 let's create a variable called doc source.
01:41:31 Okay. Pine cone vector store dot from documents. Okay. From documents
01:41:39 and inside that I'm going to store my documents. So
01:41:46 documents is equal to my text chunks. Okay. Okay, the T text chunks we created and embedding model is equal to my
01:41:52 embedding model and the index name is equal to my index name. Okay, so these three parameter you have to pass. Okay,
01:41:59 so once it is done now if I execute what it will do, it will take all of the text chunks. It will use the embedding model
01:42:06 and it will try to convert them to the vector embedding and it will store in the pine cone vector database. So it will take some time. Let's wait guys
01:42:13 because here we are having almost 5,000 chunks. So we have to wait for that. Now if I come here, if you continuously
01:42:20 refresh here, so you'll be able to see the vector count. Okay, record count. So
01:42:25 it will store one by one. And even you can also see the vector
01:43:00 Okay. Still uh because it takes some time to load. See record count 3,000.
01:43:06 Okay. 3,000 chunks it has already stored here. And you can see all of the chunks. Okay. You can see the ID. So this ID
01:43:12 would be uniquely created. Then the source source we have in the data. Then this is the text. Okay. And now this
01:43:18 text is having the vector. So if you want to see the vector, click on fetch. And this is the vector guys. This is the
01:43:25 value. So this value we we we already got from the embedding model. Okay. And the dimension is 384. Now see I I'll
01:43:32 wait for all of my vector to be stored. So this is the beauty of pine cone. You
01:43:38 can visualize everything here. But in chrom files you can't see that. So 5,000 almost still executing. Let's wait.
01:43:59 got stuck in that is possible to make it learn only the format structure of a
01:44:06 document like leave later not the content uh repical actually I'm
01:44:14 not clear your question. Okay. Uh what do you want to uh I mean why why do you
01:44:20 got stack for image
01:44:26 got stack in the possible to learn make it only format stack server documents level not please try to clarify the
01:44:32 question I'm not clear with that
01:44:37 yeah uh when you will complete the opencv course computer vision course would be
01:44:43 covered soon okay yeah so now you can see Guys, all of the chunks has been stored. That means I have in total 5,
01:44:51 um, 859 chunks. So, yeah, execution is also done. That means I'm able to
01:44:57 successfully stored all of the chunks. Okay. And it has al also converted to
01:45:02 the vector representation. Got it. Yeah.
01:45:08 Fine. Now if if you want to load any existing index because uh right uh right
01:45:14 now we created the index and we have the object right now let's say uh I want to only load this index and I want to
01:45:20 continue my work okay so how to do it so for this you can use this code load existing index
01:45:26 okay load load existing index so here you have pine cone vector store inside
01:45:33 that there is a function see previously I was using from document now you have to use from existing index and here you
01:45:38 have to give the uh index name as well as the embedding model you are using. Okay. So what it will do? It will load
01:45:44 any kinds of existing index. Okay. And it will load all of the vectors. So let's execute.
01:45:50 Now again you can use this object to continue your work. Okay. So both I showed you either you can directly
01:45:55 create and get the object either you can load any kinds of existing index if you have in the pine cone.
01:46:02 Okay. Yeah. Now if you want to add more data. So let me comment here because this part is also important because many
01:46:08 people ask this question add more data uh to the to the
01:46:17 existing pine cone index. Okay so let's say we already have a index right we already have a index uh which is running
01:46:24 here now let's say I need I I I want to store more data here because let's say I got another PDF file I got another books
01:46:30 and I want to store in the same same let's say index. So how to do it? Okay. So for this let's create a dummy
01:46:35 documents here. So I created a dummy documents. So let's say this is a dummy document. So this is the page content.
01:46:41 So I have written like about my channel DS with BAP is a YouTube channel that provides a tutorial on various topics
01:46:46 and source is equal to YouTube. Okay. So let's say this this documents I want to store to my existing index. So how to do
01:46:52 it? For this you have to use this code. Add documents. There is a function called add document. Docers dot add
01:46:59 documents. And here you have to give documents is equal to your documents inside a list. Okay. So if you pass it
01:47:05 now see if I execute. So this document would be added. Now this is the unique ID. I'll copy the ID. Now see previously
01:47:12 the count was uh uh 59. Now it's 60. Now
01:47:18 you can also search that ID. So let's say I will search that ID to find my new one.
01:47:24 So see DS with BP. Okay. So that's how if you want you can also add any kinds
01:47:29 of existing sorry any kinds of new new documents in the same index if you want
01:47:35 it's possible okay like I want to make it learn a
01:47:40 structure of document such that to make this we need a from address and address
01:47:46 subject and content but it should not read the content of labels later
01:47:53 and if I if it contests images the documents cannot purp using the chrom with the lama embeddings. Yeah, if if it
01:48:00 has the image. So for this we have to use the image embedding. Okay, I'll also create a project on top of that. Okay,
01:48:05 how how we can handle the image tables this thing as well. Got it guys? So this
01:48:12 thing I I got lots of questions how how I can add uh more data to the existing
01:48:18 um index. So that's how we can do. Okay.
01:48:25 Fine. So now here we are ready guys. We we already stored uh everything in the pine cone and this becomes my knowledge
01:48:31 base. Now we'll try to create the retriever. That means we'll try to connect the lm and user will ask the question. We'll get the response. Okay.
01:48:38 So for this let's create the retriever and that's how we create the retriever guys. So docers as retriever. There is a
01:48:44 function called as retriever. See docs as retriever and search type is equal to similarity and search keyword is equal
01:48:50 to k is equal to three. That means it will return you three relevant response. three most similarity response from the
01:48:57 knowledge base. Okay. Now let's try to test it. So for this let's say I'll give a question here.
01:49:02 Uh I'll just write uh uh let's say retrieve
01:49:10 it. Retrieve
01:49:15 docs is equal to retriever
01:49:21 dot invoke. Okay. Okay, there's a function called invoke. Now let's see if I ask what is acne.
01:49:29 Okay, so this will give you three different response.
01:49:35 See three response, three most similar response. And you can see the similarity score is also there. Each and every
01:49:42 vector has this similarity. This similarity score. Okay, this similarity score. So I'll try to refresh. Maybe
01:49:49 you'll be able to understand. So this is the beauty of pine cone. See this is
01:49:55 this code. This is this code. Okay. So based on this code actually it is returning you the three relevant
01:50:01 response from this particular question. Now this is not understandable for us. Okay. I want to uh let's say I want to
01:50:08 refine this response with my LLM right now. Now let's try to connect the LLM. So for this uh I will import the lm. So
01:50:16 from langen from lang langchen
01:50:23 uh openai uh import chat open a okay so here I'm going to use the GPT4 model so chat uh
01:50:31 chat model is equal to chat open AI uh
01:50:40 so model is equal to GPT GPT
01:50:48 4 okay let's use 4 O model okay 4 O model this model actually I'm going to use let's import it
01:50:56 then after that we'll try to create the chain lang chain okay so let's import
01:51:04 some necessary library so you you can see guys I'm importing the create retrieval chain create stuff document
01:51:10 chain and the chat prompt template okay I already covered in my langen series in my genative video guys you can go ahead
01:51:16 and check it out then I'll create a prompt template first of all so this is my prompt template
01:51:22 so here I have written you are an assistant for question answering task uh you are a following piece of retriever
01:51:27 context to answer the question if uh you don't know say thank uh that you don't know okay use the three sentence maximum
01:51:34 to keep the answer concise okay so maybe you can also modify you are an medical assistant uh medical assistant for the
01:51:42 for the for the for uh question answering task. Okay. So here you can
01:51:48 modify this prompt with respect to your requirement guys. Okay. The way actually you want the response. Then here I'm
01:51:54 creating the prompt template and here I'm giving the system prompt as well as whatever prompt user will try to pass
01:51:59 because this is a chat model I'm using and chat model takes two input system prompt as well as the user prompt. Okay.
01:52:04 So this will become my prompt. Right now here I'm going to create a chain. So that's how we create the chain guys. So
01:52:10 create uh stuff document chain. You have to give the chat model and you have to pass the prompt. After that create
01:52:18 retrieval chain. So here you have to pass the retriever the retriever you created here and you also need to pass the question
01:52:25 answer chain. Okay. Now this will become your rag chain right now. Now here you can ask any kinds of
01:52:32 question. So let's say here I will ask a question. So this is one kinds of disease guys. uh
01:52:39 acro uh uh acromegali and giganizome
01:52:45 you can search in the pdf so let me show you I'll open the pdf I'll ctrl f and
01:52:53 see this is this is the disease this is the disease okay I'm asking about this particular disease and whatever response
01:52:59 I'm having I'm getting the answer only now I think it should return me the correct response guys of this disease
01:53:05 see this is a disorder caused by the abnormal release of the chemicals from
01:53:12 the pituitary gland leading to the increased growth in the bones and soft
01:53:18 tissues. Okay, it occurs after bones grow growth has stopped. When this uh
01:53:23 abnormally happens before growth steps, it results in gigantism characterized by unusual
01:53:32 height. So you can see this is the disease. Okay, this is the disease they're talking about this particular
01:53:38 disease. Okay, that means my um chatbot is working perfectly right now. And this
01:53:43 is the power of rack guys. Okay, this is the power of rag.
01:53:52 Okay, now let's uh ask another question here. So I'll ask uh what is
01:54:02 what is let's say acne.
01:54:11 So acne is a common skin disease characterized by pimples on the face, chest and back. It occurs when the
01:54:17 skin's uh pores become uh clogged with oil and dead skin cells and bacteria.
01:54:23 The medical terms for the common acne is a acne vulgaris. Okay. Now let's say if
01:54:28 I ask like what is the treatment of acne so it should also suggest me the treatment because in the PDF it has all
01:54:34 kinds of information the treatment the diagnosis. Okay. The medicine. So see the treatment of the acne depends on the
01:54:40 severity for the midn acne. CC this is the treatment it is suggesting. Okay.
01:54:46 Yeah. Now I think I also given uh the information about my channel DS with bi. So maybe it can also give the response.
01:54:52 Let's say what is DS with Buppy. So I think it should give me the response. See DS with Buppy's YouTube channel that
01:54:58 provides tutorials on the various topic. Yeah. So that means my chatbot is perfectly working guys. Okay. My
01:55:03 notebook is perfectly working. There is no error. Now we are ready for the modular code implementation. Okay. So
01:55:10 here uh this part is done. Now let's try to implement the modular coding. So till here guys everything is clear. Let me
01:55:17 know. Please let me know guys. If clear please hit a like all of you. If clear
01:55:23 please hit a like all of you guys. Now we will be implementing the modular coding.
01:55:35 Okay. And now we'll try to copy paste the same code from the notebook. Okay. Because the actual code we have already written. So writing modular coding is
01:55:42 very easy right now. Okay. So let's uh implement the modular coding. Okay. So
01:55:47 for this first of all I'll try to open up the helper.py pi and inside that I'm going to write uh keep some of the
01:55:53 function I used in the notebooks. Okay. So the first function guys I think
01:55:59 remember we we u we use this load PDF. Okay. Load PDF
01:56:06 uh because it will load the PDF documents. Let me select my environment. Uh this is uh
01:56:13 medbot. Okay. Now this error will disappear. Yeah. Then the second function the filter to minimal.
01:56:20 See the same code I'm copy pasting from my notebook guys I think remember. So here we have already written. So load
01:56:26 PDF then the filter to minimal. Okay. Then the
01:56:33 third one the split documents that mean the chunking.
01:56:38 Okay. Then the fourth one the download embedding model.
01:56:45 So I'm downloading the sentence transformer model. Okay, that's it. So these are the function I'll try to keep in the helper.py because I I want this
01:56:52 function and then I don't want to write every time. So I'll if I need it, I'll try to call from the helper.py itself.
01:56:58 Okay, this is the idea. And I think remember we also created a prompt template here. So we'll try to keep the
01:57:04 prompt in the prompt.py. So let's try to keep it. So this is the prompt.
01:57:10 Okay, this is the prompt. So you are an an
01:57:16 assistant. Okay. So this will take the context. All
01:57:22 right. So prompt is done, helper is done. Now uh first module we'll be writing
01:57:29 uh for storing the vector in the knowledge base. Okay. So for this let's create another file here. I'm going to
01:57:34 name it as store_index.py.
01:57:40 pi. Okay. And here I'm going to copy paste
01:57:45 the same code I written in the notebook. That means this part. So here first of
01:57:50 all I'll load the documents uh do the filtering. Then after that we'll do the
01:57:56 chunking. After chunking we'll try to get the embedding model. After that we'll try to convert to the vector
01:58:02 embedding. That is create the pine core instance. Then uh store as a vector embedding. Okay. So till here we'll try
01:58:08 to copy paste the same code.
01:58:14 So this is the code guys. Okay. So you can see I'm loading all the necessary library from helper. I'm loading load
01:58:21 PDF filter minimal docs text and hanging face. Then pine cone serverless. Okay each and everything. Then loading the
01:58:26 env file then uh setting as environment variable. Then loading the data then
01:58:32 filtering to the minimal. Then perform the chunking. Downloading the embedding model. then initializing the pine cone
01:58:38 creating the index okay so we already have the index uh name right so let's say I'll give the same name
01:58:46 medical chatbot so this is the automated file guys right now we have done everything with the help of this
01:58:53 notebook but right now I'll try to do with my python script okay this is the idea so medical chatbot it will create
01:58:59 the index after that it will store all of the vector in the embedding okay yeah now let me test this file but before
01:59:04 that let me delete my existing index I have here. So I try to delete
01:59:10 this medical chatbot. Let's delete it. Let's give the confirmation.
01:59:17 Delete. Yeah, it's deleted. Now let's execute
01:59:22 this store index.py to again create my index and store all of the vector as
01:59:27 embedding. So python uh store index.py. Okay. Now if I
01:59:34 execute so again it will run all the pipeline one by one and I'll come here
01:59:40 and I'll try to wait for my vector.
01:59:54 So it's getting executed. Let's wait guys. Okay, it will take some time because again it will store all of the
02:00:00 chunks. Okay, so it will take some time. Let's wait.
02:00:18 Okay, medical chatbot is created. Now inside that it will store all of my vector. See executing is going execution
02:00:26 is going on.
02:00:31 So that's how guys actual development happens. Uh you have to go step by step
02:00:36 uh neat and clean code and uh definitely a proper plan, proper architecture
02:00:42 and uh selection of proper tool stack. So then you will be able to uh implement any kinds of system with any kinds of
02:00:49 problem statement.
02:01:06 Yeah. So, 4,000 uh chunks has already stored. Let's wait for the execution
02:01:24 pre-image embedding
02:01:30 model.
02:01:38 See you can use this embedding model clip vit then tiny clip and nomic embed
02:01:45 vision okay it is available in the hugging face who is asking this question
02:01:50 uh are what we have image in the PDF for this
02:01:57 we we will be using another technique okay multimodel technique timeless but this this problem statement doesn't need
02:02:03 any kinds of image okay That's why we don't need it. Okay, my execution is completed. Now, if I come here in my
02:02:09 pine cone, if I refresh, see all of my vector is present here. Okay, so right
02:02:15 now it's 59 because I didn't store the DS with BP because that one I did with my notebook. All right, so my index is
02:02:22 working fine and we're able to store the index. Now, right now, we'll try to create the
02:02:28 uh app app.py. Okay, so now let's try to create my app.py, Pi guys because we are
02:02:33 very uh close to our application right now.
02:02:39 So here we'll be using the flask guys. Uh and I think you know how to use the flask. Uh for this you need two folders.
02:02:48 Uh you need something called template and you need starting. Okay. So let's
02:02:53 create uh one by one. So here you need
02:03:00 template. Okay, it should be templates. Okay, inside that you create the HTML file. So
02:03:07 I'm going to name it as chat
02:03:12 do HTML and let's mention the HTML code here. See, I already created a basic uh
02:03:19 user interface for you. Uh so this is the HTML code for that. And if you are not familiar with HTML code guys, it's
02:03:26 completely fine. Okay, you can also generate with chat GPT. You can uh there are some different different templates
02:03:32 is also available like chatbot free template free uh HTML
02:03:39 and CSS template. So there are some many website okay they will they will provide you free free template you can use. Okay
02:03:47 not this one I think free chatbot template. So see like there are many website so
02:03:54 you can go to the website and you can collect the code
02:03:59 okay you can go to the website you can collect the code okay so that's how guys
02:04:04 I uh implemented a basic template for you and this is the HTML code for that okay you can go through that then I need
02:04:11 another folder called static
02:04:16 static and inside that I'll keep the CSS file that means for the designing
02:04:21 Uh I'll try to keep the style dot CSS. So let's create a file
02:04:27 style dot CSS. Okay.
02:04:35 So this is the CSS style that means the color style. Okay. Everything I have
02:04:41 added here. Let me save. Yeah. Now let me show you how this uh this uh
02:04:48 interface will look like. how the front end will look like. For this, let's launch my app.py. So, first of all, I'm
02:04:54 going to import all of the necessary library. Okay. So here you can see I'm importing flask from uh different different
02:05:02 function. Then download hugging face embedding model, pine cone, chat, openi. Then all the langen chain part. Okay.
02:05:09 The thing uh things I imported in my notebook everything I have imported here. And the from prompt also I'm also
02:05:14 importing all of the prompt. Okay. Yeah. Now I'll first of all initialize my
02:05:19 app.py that means my flask. So for this is the flask initialization code. Okay
02:05:24 you can go to the flask documentation you will be able to understand how to initialize it. So once it is ready now
02:05:30 I'll try to create a basic route that is my uh default route. So this is the default route. If you open the
02:05:36 application it will render the HTML dot stat HTML and to execute the app. This
02:05:42 is the code. So here I'm running on local host port number 80080. Okay, now
02:05:48 let me show you guys how your app look like. So I'll open up my terminal. Clear. So python app.py.
02:05:56 It's running. So now let's open up my local host.
02:06:05 Local host port number 8080.
02:06:11 So this is the interface guys. Okay. This is the uh chatbot interface. Okay,
02:06:17 we'll be using. Thank you so much. Uh timeless talk
02:06:24 maya how to execute an AI idea from A to Z like a startup. Please make a series
02:06:30 about that. Not it. Yeah. So guys, this is the interface. Okay. This is the
02:06:35 interface of the chatbot. Now here user can give any kinds of message and they can get the response. Okay. But let's
02:06:41 try to make it functional. So here what I'm going to do, I'm going to um write
02:06:47 some more code. First of all, let's load my OpenAI API key
02:06:53 because here I need to load my model as well as the embedding model uh to load
02:06:58 my index. So this thing you have to import. Okay. So the same uh code I
02:07:05 written in my uh notebook, I'm importing it here. Okay. Then I will load my
02:07:10 embedding model and try to load the index because I want to load my existing index right now. My index is already running
02:07:17 in the pine cone cloud. So first of all uh load the embedding then uh give the
02:07:22 index name. So what is the index name guys? Index name is nothing but uh medical chatbot.
02:07:29 Copy and try to give it here.
02:07:34 Sorry medical chatbot.
02:07:45 What I can do? I can copy from here.
02:07:58 Done. Now once my index is loaded, I'll got my doc search. Then I'll try to
02:08:04 create my chain. So this is the chain code I think remember
02:08:11 same code I written in the notebook ret then initializing the openi model prompt. I'm loading the prompt and this
02:08:18 is the chain rag chen and for this I will create another route.
02:08:24 So whenever user will click on this uh chat okay click on this send button. So
02:08:29 this route will be executed that means it will get a get okay get uh get message then uh whatever message user is
02:08:36 sending in this form I'm receiving it here input then I'm executing in my rag
02:08:42 chain okay input is equal to message then whatever response I'm getting I'm showing in the uh chatbot okay so this
02:08:48 is ready now let me save and if I come here if I refresh
02:09:05 you're done. Now let's send a message. Let's say I'll give hi.
02:09:12 So see hello. How I can assist you? So I'll ask the same question I asked in my notebook. So here I'll copy
02:09:22 I will ask for this disease.
02:09:31 Now see amazingly it is giving you the response. Now let's ask another question. What is acne?
02:09:44 Yeah. So this is the acne. Now I'll ask for the treatment.
02:09:56 So this is the statement. Now if I give let's say hey I got
02:10:02 sudden fever. Uh what should
02:10:10 I do?
02:10:17 So see this is inter uh giving you inter uh suggestion on top of that. Okay. So
02:10:22 that's how guys you can uh build the entire medical system. Okay. Now you
02:10:27 have your chatbot. Now if you are having any issue you can interact with your chatbot to get the response to get the
02:10:34 suggestion. Okay. Based on that you can take the decision. Got it guys? Now this is the application
02:10:40 is running on my local host. Now our task is to uh create this uh make this application public. So we have to deploy
02:10:47 it right now. So our application is completely ready. So let's deploy the application guys. So I'll first of all
02:10:54 update my GitHub. So here I'll write
02:11:00 uh web app completed. Let's commit the changes.
02:11:28 Done. Now if I go to my GitHub refresh, so all of the code is updated. Yeah. So
02:11:36 guys, you can fork it. You can also restart this repository all of you. Okay. Just try to start the repository as well.
02:11:44 Okay. So guys, I think uh you understood. Let me know all of you.
02:11:50 So we completed the entire deployment sorry uh development. Now it is time for the deployment. Let me know guys.
02:11:58 If yes uh please uh try to hit the like. It has the memory or not. No, currently I haven't added the memory. But if you
02:12:04 want you can also add the memory. It is also super easy. So for this you can use uh
02:12:10 um conversation buffer memory.
02:12:19 So I already discussed in my langen series. Okay. So in my YouTube channel I
02:12:24 want to give you as a task guys. Okay. So you you can see I also have a video
02:12:29 on langen one short video. So langen. Okay. So here I talked about the memory. Okay.
02:12:36 How we can integrate the memory. Just try to see that. Okay. Conversation b memory you can add here. Very easy.
02:12:42 Okay. It is like very easy. Only one line of code you have to add.
02:12:51 Yeah, conversation buffer memory is there. Summary memory is there. Okay, you can
02:12:57 use any of them. Just try to go through the video. It's just a one line of code.
02:13:04 Okay. So now we are ready for the deployment. Okay. Now let's try to deploy the project over the AWS cloud.
02:13:12 Okay. So for the deployment guys uh I will be following some step. So let me
02:13:20 show you the step I'm going to follow
02:13:26 just a minute.
02:13:41 So here in the readme file I'm going to add all of these step.
02:13:51 So let me commit the changes. Read me
02:13:58 updated.
02:14:07 I will go to my GitHub. So let's close these other tab.
02:14:13 Yeah. So refresh. So see guys this is the step we are going to follow. See I also added this
02:14:19 step like what to do after cloning my repo. Create av file because file I have committed I haven't committed yet. Okay.
02:14:26 So create a pine cone API key. Give your API key. Open ap. Okay. After that you
02:14:32 have to execute the store index.py to generate the index of the pine cone. Then app.py. Okay, then this is the
02:14:39 deployment step guys we'll be following right now. Okay, AWS sed deployment. So first of all we'll be logging with the
02:14:45 as console. So this is my AWS account guys. So if you don't have the account first of all
02:14:50 try to uh create one account. Okay all of you try to create a account uh then
02:14:56 try to follow the deployment along with me.
02:15:08 Sir can you please share how to deploy this ism cubernet is also fine tuning
02:15:13 part as well uh cubernetes deployment I think I created a video just go through that okay currently I don't have the um
02:15:21 um Google cloud with me okay
02:15:26 all right so now uh here the first thing guys let me let me I think uh copy of
02:15:32 this repo. Yeah, now I can follow this one. So, first of all here I will uh create a
02:15:39 IM user for the deployment. So, let's create IM user. I'll click on the IM.
02:15:46 Okay, I'll click on the IM.
02:15:56 So let's click on the user.
02:16:02 So here I'll create a new user. I'll give the name. I'll give let's say medical
02:16:08 chatbot uh chatbot
02:16:14 or click on next. I'll attach the policy
02:16:23 because here I I want to give some specific permission not all the permission. Okay, that's why. So here uh
02:16:29 you can provide some permission like uh I only need the ECR ECR and EC2
02:16:36 machine. Okay, these two two uh access. So this is the access guys. Just try to copy the policy
02:16:42 and try to add s here. So first of all I am giving EC2 uh okay EC2 permission
02:16:49 and then once it is done try to close it then copy the
02:16:54 uh sorry this is the ECR. Okay. And this is the EC2.
02:17:01 I'll select it. And once it is done, I'll click on next.
02:17:09 Then create the user. See just behind me there is a button. Okay. Create user. I'm clicking on that.
02:17:16 So user is created. Okay. With a permission of EC2 and ECR. I I I need these two service only for the
02:17:21 deployment. I don't use like all of the service. So this is called user management. I'm giving my uh permission
02:17:28 like what are the service I want to use and this is the deployment process guys. So here first of all we'll try to build
02:17:34 and docker image for the source code. Push your uh docker image to the ECR. Launch the EC2 machine. Pull your uh
02:17:41 image from ECR to EC2. Launch your Docker image in the EC2. Okay. This is the entire deployment step we'll try to
02:17:46 follow. So yeah, my user is created. So I think there are too many tab. I can close it. delete all of them.
02:17:58 Yeah. Okay. So my user is created. Okay. Now here I'll go inside the user. I have to
02:18:04 create uh the access token and secret access token. Okay. So for this click on the security credential
02:18:12 and and and see yeah there are some alternative model also. Open router you
02:18:17 can use. Grock you can use okay anything you can use. uh access key. So create access key
02:18:24 command line CLI. I understand above recommendation. Then click on the next
02:18:31 then create the access key. So this is the access key and secret access key. I need it for the deployment guys. Okay.
02:18:37 So I'll try to download as a CSV file. Just keep it with you. Okay. This CSV file you need later on. Now I'll go to
02:18:43 my AWS again. Now the next process guys uh you have to create the ECR report to
02:18:49 store the uh docker base. So let's do it. I'll search for ECR ER
02:18:57 elastic container registry. I'll open it up.
02:19:06 Then I'll create the repo. So here you can give the repo name. So
02:19:13 I'll give medical bot.
02:19:19 Uh keep it everything as default and click on create.
02:19:24 Yeah. So now copy this URI and save it somewhere. Okay. I need it later on. So maybe I can save it some here just for
02:19:31 the future reference. Okay. Yeah. Done.
02:19:38 Okay. So my uh ECR repo is also created. Now I have to create the EC2 machine
02:19:43 virtual machine. So for this again I'll go back to my AWS and search for EC2 instance
02:19:52 open it up
02:19:59 okay so here I'll click on launch instance and currently you can see I'm working in
02:20:05 the US East1 region. Okay. So make sure you also check your region.
02:20:11 So give the machine name. So I'll give medical machine
02:20:20 and I'll select the Ubuntu instance. Okay, let's select the Ubuntu instance because deployment servers we always use
02:20:26 Ubuntu instance. Okay, Linux instance and instance type I'll be taking at
02:20:31 least uh at least let's say 8 GB memory. Okay, 8 GB memory. I will take this
02:20:36 instance. You can see there are lots of instance. Let's take 8 GB memory
02:20:42 and this is the per hour cost. Okay, per hour cost. Uh you can see now select the
02:20:47 key value pair. I'll create a new one. I'll give let's say medical chat bot. Uh
02:20:54 let's create the file and select it here. Okay, this file you need. Let's say if you want to access your instance
02:21:00 with any third party tool. Let's say put your mobile extreme that time you can use that. But I don't need that because I'll be opening this uh terminal this
02:21:08 machine in a separate terminal in AWS only. Now try to select this uh HTTP and
02:21:14 HTTP https and http and storage wise let's take 30 GB storage everything in
02:21:20 five. Now try to launch the instance. Okay, just behind me there is a button. Click here.
02:21:30 Now I'll click on view all instance. Yeah. So now status is pending. Now
02:21:37 let's refresh.
02:21:47 So it should be running. Okay. Now see my instance is running. I'll click on instance ID and it is running. You can
02:21:54 see. So here what I will do I'll uh try to connect this uh instance.
02:22:00 Keep it default everything. And there is a connect button. Just try to click here. It will give me a black terminal. Okay.
02:22:08 In the terminal, we'll try to make the setup and we'll try to do all the configuration for the deployment.
02:22:25 Yeah. So, let's clear. So, this is my production server, guys. Okay. This is
02:22:31 the Ubuntu Linux environment and uh you need some Linux uh command guys. You need to understand some Linux command
02:22:36 because in production we always use Linux and for this you can check out my MLOps course. So here I'm going to do
02:22:43 some setup and these are some command guys you have to execute. First of all let's update the machine. I'll copy and
02:22:50 execute.
02:23:05 Now copy the next command
02:23:12 here. Let's give VS permission.
02:23:23 Here this is the new machine. Right here we are doing the update operation. Some required tools and package we are
02:23:28 updating
02:23:52 then copy the next command. So now we'll be we have to install the docker. Okay, docker in the uh machine we created
02:23:58 because we don't have docker installed here. So this is this is the command to install the docker. This command you
02:24:04 have to execute. Let's install it. So currently if I run docker command see there is no docker
02:24:11 version. See there is no docker. Okay. So let's install the docker.
02:24:18 Then I'll copy the next command. This one
02:24:25 it is installing Docker right now.
02:24:44 Okay. Then this command and the last command
02:24:53 done. Now if I execute the same command docker version
02:24:59 docker version. Now see docker is running. Okay. This is the version uh we have
02:25:06 installed here. Fine. So now everything is running. Now we have to configure our EC2 as a self-hosted runner. Okay. For
02:25:11 this go to your project setting. Okay. Now this is my GitHub repo guys. Make sure you're using your repository not my
02:25:17 repository. Go to the setting. Then here you will see one option called
02:25:23 action then runner. Then new self-hosted runner.
02:25:30 Then here select the Linux and you have to execute this command. So let's copy the first command and execute in the
02:25:37 terminal. That means we are doing the connection with our uh AWS right now.
02:25:43 Okay, because in GitHub whenever there is a code new code you will try to commit it will automatically trigger my
02:25:49 CI/CD and my as will deploy everything. Okay, that's why you're making the connection. Now copy the third command
02:25:57 one by one we have to copy all of the command.
02:26:03 And then the fourth command
02:26:12 done. Now two more command you have to execute in the configured section. So this command.
02:26:21 So say GitHub action connected to the GitHub. Now it is telling enter the name
02:26:26 of the runner groups you want to add. Uh I don't want to give anything. I'll press enter. Now it is telling enter the
02:26:32 name of the runner. I'll give self hyphen hosted. Make sure you give the same name. Okay. Uh then it's telling
02:26:40 additional label. I'll press enter. Now name of the work folder. I'll press
02:26:45 enter. Now it's done. Now you have to execute the last command. This one. Now
02:26:51 your uh GitHub would be connected with the AWS. See connected to the GitHub listening
02:26:58 for the jobs. That means now my runner has connected. Now if you want to check it, go to the runner again
02:27:04 and you can see starter is idle right now. Okay, this is connected. Okay, so now we are ready for the
02:27:10 deployment guys. Okay, but before that here you have to set the secret. Okay, secret that means AWS access key secret
02:27:16 key region EC pine cone open. Okay, because if you don't have the credential
02:27:22 how it will authenticate with the account. So you have to give the secret as well. So let's add the secret. So to
02:27:27 add the secret go to the secret and variable go to the action and here you
02:27:33 will see repository secret. Okay. So I'll click new repository secret. Let's copy the name. First of all I'll give
02:27:39 AWS access key ID and here you have to give the secret and
02:27:44 where you will get the access key ID guys remember we downloaded a CSV file. So let's open it up. I'll open in my
02:27:50 notepad. Not this one. I think this secret. Okay.
02:27:56 There is a CSV file. So this is the secret and don't share the secret with anyone otherwise they will be accessing
02:28:01 your account. Okay. I'll copy the access key ID and paste it here. Add secret.
02:28:09 Then I will create a new repository secret. Next one is my AWS secret access
02:28:15 key. I'll copy the secret access key.
02:28:22 See after the comma this one you know secret access key. Okay. And before the comma this one here access key ID
02:28:29 just here add secret then new repository secret again I'll do
02:28:35 it for my region. Region is nothing but US- East one. Make
02:28:42 sure you check your region. Okay, I'm inside US east one. If you are in other region you can give the same ID. So here
02:28:49 US one then new repository secret
02:28:55 uh ECR repo. Okay, I'll copy the name paste it here. ECR repo name. What is
02:29:00 the repo name guys? Repon is medical chatbot. Just copy this repo name and paste it here.
02:29:10 Then next one is my pine cone API key. Copy that. Give it here. Pine cone API
02:29:17 key. And what is the pine cone API key? So we have in the environment variable.
02:29:23 Let's copy it and paste it here.
02:29:32 This is the pine cone. Yeah. Now let me add the secret. Now I have for my open AI. Okay. Open
02:29:40 AI. Open AI. So I'll quickly add this openi
02:29:46 guys in my other screen because I don't want to show my openi uh like secret.
02:29:52 Okay. So I'll do it in my other screen.
02:30:14 Yeah. So, open A is also added here.
02:30:22 Fine. Okay. So, all of the secret is added guys. Nothing is left. Now, we are ready for the deployment. But before
02:30:28 that, here you need a Docker file. So, let's create a Docker file.
02:30:35 So, here you have to give the Docker command. So, let's add the Docker command.
02:30:44 darker.
02:30:50 Just a minute. Yeah. So
02:30:58 this is the docker command. So here we're taking the python image 3.10 10 creating a working
02:31:05 directory copy all of the source code require uh installing requirements and after that here uh we we are uh
02:31:13 executing our app.py Pi. Okay. So now uh here I need another file
02:31:18 called GitHub action.
02:31:25 U GitHub. Okay. GitHub because here we are using GitHub action and we have to create the workflow. So dot GitHub
02:31:32 inside that there is there should be another folder called workflow.
02:31:39 Okay. Workflows I think. Workflows.
02:31:45 Okay, inside that we have to create a file called CICDL.
02:31:52 Inside that I have to mention all of the CI/CD related command.
02:32:04 So let me show you.
02:32:12 So this is the CI/CD command guys. See, so this is this is for the GitHub
02:32:18 action. Okay. So this one you will be getting in the internet. Okay. Mostly in the GitHub actions, if you search like
02:32:24 GitHub action CI/CD uh command, you will be getting this command. Okay. So here we are doing the continuous integration
02:32:30 inside that. First of all, you're authenticating with our account. Then logging to the ECR, building the Docker image and pushing it to the ECR. Then
02:32:38 continuous deployment. We are again authenticating with the AWS account. We are uh taking the image and running on
02:32:43 my EC2 machine. Okay. And all the docker command actually you can see here. Okay. So this is the yl file I need guys. Uh
02:32:51 cicdml for the deployment. Okay. Now let me do a verify. So we got github action
02:32:57 workflows cicd.l. Okay. Everything is fine. Now we are ready to deploy guys. So now what I'll do I'll try to push the
02:33:04 changes. Okay. So here I'll just write cicd addit.
02:33:10 Now seeing the changes. Now automatically your deployment will start.
02:33:15 Done. Now if I open up my GitHub.
02:33:22 So here you can see action is running. I'll go to the action. Uh open the action. Now see continuous integration
02:33:29 is running. So it is right now building my docker image. Okay. Let's wait.
02:33:35 So once uh this execution is complete then we'll be able to see the app.
02:34:41 Yeah. So this would be available. Okay. Because we are doing live after the live it would be saved as a recorded on the
02:34:47 YouTube worth. Okay. Yeah. And check out this playlist always. Okay. So in this
02:34:52 playlist all the video would be added end to end generative project. So this is the playlist.
02:35:00 This one.
02:35:13 Okay. So, let's wait uh for the completion.
02:35:20 And please guys uh all of you give the like and subscribe to my channel. Please try to support my channel guys. Let's
02:35:27 hit 50k subscriber as soon as possible. Let's take a target. It's possible guys. If you give your support so definitely
02:35:34 everything is possible and let me know if you need anything else. I'll try to provide that also.
02:35:46 No barcel I I didn't deploy. See you can also deploy on the render. There is another service called render. So render
02:35:52 you don't need to do this many of configuration because here we're doing the custom deployment we we are creating
02:35:57 the custom instance so that's why we have u done so many uh steps okay but in
02:36:03 render you can simply do the deployment also
02:36:14 so now see image is built now it is pushing the image to the ECR so I can show you my ECR as well let's open the
02:36:21 AWS Let's go to the elastic container registry. Uh right now there is nothing.
02:36:29 Okay. Once the execution is complete, you will see the image.
02:36:38 Yeah, sure. Threat. We'll try to see that.
02:37:11 So this part usually takes time guys. Let's wait.
02:37:16 It's just a one time setup. Okay. Once you have done the setup, next time only you just need to commit your code. It
02:37:22 will automatically get deployed.
02:38:21 I like your projects. AI job recommends
02:38:32 industries started adopting. I will also talk about that. Okay. Tri in my channel.
02:38:43 So in between let's have have some water guys have some water or anything I think this process will take some time and I
02:38:50 think almost uh almost 3 hours almost two uh I think it's more than uh
02:38:58 two and a half hours right guys we are implementing this project
02:39:03 on live yeah so this is fun right always live
02:39:09 live coding is fun And you are also staying with me. So I I
02:39:15 really appreciate that guys. And next time I want just try to sit with your
02:39:20 system. You can also implement with me because real time also committing the code on my GitHub. Try to fetch it and
02:39:26 try to execute from from your end. Yeah.
02:39:32 So let me know guys recording is better or this kinds of live session is better? Because in recording what happens
02:39:39 just to make the uh recording simple some sometimes we also skip some of the part okay but in live uh I I can uh I
02:39:48 can explain everything okay in detail so I I always like the live uh implementation so you can let me know
02:39:55 which one you feel uh more comfortable maybe I'll try to um give that content
02:40:03 in a recorded mode or live mode let me
02:40:09 live session. Okay, thank you.
02:40:19 Yeah, even we we also can clarify the question live. Okay, this is another fun.
02:40:24 Yeah, fine. So guys, you can see continuous integration is done. Now continuous deployment is running. So now
02:40:30 it is running the docker image from in the EC2 machine after pulling it. Now if I show my elastic image guys, elastic
02:40:37 container registry. So there is the docker image. See the docker image is pushed here. Okay. So now let's wait for
02:40:43 the continuous deployment
02:40:55 during LLM coding. We can explain on the live for the AWS deploy mostly same commands we can do record. Yeah. So uh
02:41:02 that thing we can refer. See uh currently I'm showing you the deployment on live. Maybe in later project I'm not
02:41:08 going to show you the deployment again. So you can refer this this deployment as a reference. Okay. Th
02:41:15 you can um use that as a reference
02:41:22 because yeah most of the deployment will remain same. So we are not supposed to do again and again.
02:41:32 Now see it is pulling the image. Let's wait.
02:41:46 Why to get front end template for such projects? It is available over the internet. Just try to search free uh
02:41:52 chatbot HTML and CSS template. There are many website they will give you the code. Download it and use it. Otherwise
02:41:58 you can also generate with the help of chart GPT. So nowadays everyone use chat
02:42:04 GP to gen generate this kinds of work. Okay. Yeah.
02:42:47 Any
02:42:57 any other question guys? Let me know in between. Let's take some query.
02:43:14 When uh targeting specific geni role do we need indepth yolo as well or till CNN
02:43:23 work better when targeting specific geni role do we need in-depth yolo as well or
02:43:30 till CNN works better uh see uh if you are targeting for the geni role so uh
02:43:36 you don't need to deep dive in the computer vision okay so try to deep dive in the geni only but knowing computer
02:43:42 vision will help you a lot to understand the multimodel.
02:43:48 Yeah. So, pine cone version was changed when you saw the last time. Okay. That's why I I'm I I took this project for the
02:43:54 reimplementation. Okay. So that I can show you the updated one. Now see guys, deployment is done. Uh both of the
02:44:00 execution is completed. Now uh I will go to the uh instance. Uh let's copy this
02:44:07 IP address. Okay. IP address. Now if I paste it here. Now see if I execute it
02:44:12 will not work. Okay, because we haven't added the port yet because my application is running on port number
02:44:18 8080. Okay, we have to add this port. How we can add the port? So for this uh
02:44:23 you can see in the instance go to the security then security groups. Okay.
02:44:31 Then we can see edit inbound rules. Click here. Then add rules. Custom TCP
02:44:37 port number 8080. Now select 000. So that means you can access from anywhere
02:44:43 and save the rows. Then go to the instance uh click on the instance ID. Now copy the IP address and
02:44:50 again replace here and give port number 8080. Okay. Now if I hit enter, see you
02:44:56 can see your chatbot is it is live. Okay, it is live. Now I can also share this URL with you. You can also access
02:45:04 my chatbot guys. But initially if you send any message it will take some time because it has to download that sentence
02:45:10 transformer model. I think remember it is downloading from the hugging face. It's around 500 MB. So you have to give
02:45:15 some time to download the model. Okay. If you're using open source embedding model but if you're using u this uh I
02:45:22 mean open a embedding model uh it will not take time. Okay. For the first time execution it will take some time because
02:45:28 it has to download the model. Okay. I hope you got it. So yes guys, currently our application is live and we have
02:45:33 successfully deployed and this is called CI/CD, continuous integration, continuous deployment. Okay. Now next
02:45:39 time if you add any other feature, if you dep uh commit the code, it will again retake the uh new update and it
02:45:47 will deploy over the AWS cloud without stopping your server. Okay. Now let's see if I close this terminal also. Let's
02:45:53 say this this this window. Okay. If I also close it now, still my application will run. Okay. Yeah. and it is running
02:46:00 in the docker container right now. Okay. Now let's try to see how we can uh close
02:46:06 and terminate all the instance because if I keep on running it it will charge me. So for this uh first of all here I'm
02:46:13 going to stop my instance. So go to the instance and select the instance instance state and terminate and delete.
02:46:19 Okay. You can stop it. If you stop it it will charge for the storage. Okay. And if you terminate and delete it will
02:46:24 delete everything. Let's delete everything. I'll delete.
02:46:34 So now see it is shutting down. Okay. After some time it would be deleted. Now I also need to delete my uh elastic
02:46:41 repository. Okay. So I'll go to the repository medical bot. Delete.
02:46:50 Okay. Then I will also delete my uh IM user. So, let's delete it. I'll go to
02:46:57 the IM user.
02:47:05 Select the user and delete everything. So, here I'll give the confirm message.
02:47:15 Deactive the key. Confirm and delete. Yeah. So, everything is deleted guys.
02:47:21 Now, it won't be charging you. So can we uh upload code from gith code from
02:47:27 github directly to render without as yes you can do it. Okay. And render it is possible. There is different different
02:47:32 option. Either you can uh uh deploy as a docker image. Either you can take as a code. Okay. Everything is possible.
02:47:38 Yeah. Okay. I'm quering and it working truth. Okay. Great. Now it won't be working
02:47:44 because I have terminated I have terminated this instance. Okay. Now you can see not it will not work because my
02:47:50 instant got deleted. Okay. Now you can try guys from your end. You can use your account to do to the deployment and you
02:47:56 can try internally. Yeah. So guys uh this is the entire implementation. Now let me know guys how was the entire
02:48:02 development. Did you like it? Let me know guys. Did you like it? How was the entire development?
02:48:08 If you like it so please try to uh send like I like it or I didn't like
02:48:15 it. If you have any feedbacks just let me know guys. It was helpful guys. This kinds of
02:48:21 implementation do you want?
02:48:33 Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Really appreciate it, guys. Thank you. Yeah.
02:48:41 Yeah. I have a question. Please ask. What is your question?
02:48:54 Great session. I I more about dynamic memory of agency in part definitely we'll be discussing about. Thank you so
02:49:00 much. Okay guys, great. And now it's your uh
02:49:05 turn uh you you just need to practice you you just need to develop and
02:49:11 definitely you will be able to uh do any kinds of project. Where do you work? I worked uh uh in a company it is in
02:49:18 United State called Quantum Human. Okay. Yeah. I'm working as a IML developer.
02:49:25 Knowledge graph is good for the for rag or not. Yeah. So see there are types of
02:49:31 rag. Okay. So every types of rag has every potential different potential. I'll also discuss about Hamid. Okay. I
02:49:37 want to join your team. Uh uh yes definitely you can join. If there
